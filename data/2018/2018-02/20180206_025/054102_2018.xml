                  <P>(iv) Liaise with Statutory Undertakers, Designer, Contractor etc. as necessary to ensure compliance with the proposed design and verification of the costs for the diversionary routes/or protection works and provide recommendations.</P>
                  <P>(v) Risk Management and Mitigation Review. Appraisal of Utility designs and programme to identify key risks to programme delivery and the measures taken to identify and mitigate these by Undertakers and relevant parties (i.e. Designer, Contractor etc.).</P>
                  <P>(vi) Specialist technical support relating to utility queries, dispute resolutions etc. which may involve, but not be limited to: attendance at meetings, preparation of draft correspondence, providing adhoc advice and recommendations.</P>
                  <P>The appointed Consultants will be required to have personnel with specialist experience of reviewing utility diversion/protection proposals, with an in depth understanding of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 and New Roads and Street Works Act 1991, as well as Transport Scotland’s and Statutory Undertakers contract requirements.</P>

The framework agreement will be for a period of 4 years. Contracts called off the framework will be of varying length depending on individual project requirements. This contract will not divided into lots as the service will generally be used on complex projects and will typically be interrelated therefore it would make it unreasonably complex to administer the contract in this manner.</P>
                  <P>To be considered for this contract, Economic Operators are required to complete the European Single Procurement Document (ESPD) in accordance with this Contract Notice.

               <P>The maximum cumulative score resulting from the summation of the nine economic and financial standing aggregated scores shall be 50 marks.
