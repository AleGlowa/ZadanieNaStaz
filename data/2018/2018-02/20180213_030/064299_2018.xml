The project aims to improve and modernise bus operations in Batumi through the purchase of a new bus fleet of electric and diesel buses.</P><P>Assignment description</P><P>The bank will provide institution building assistance to the company in the form of a corporate development programme and a stakeholder participation programme as outlined below. For this purpose the client now intends to retain a consulting company (the Consultant) to provide the following services (the “Assignment”):</P><P>Part I: Corporate development programme for the company</P><P>The consultant will assist the company to improve its commercial standing, service and environmental/social performance by supporting the development and implementation of relevant policies for corporate, financial, operational and environmental/social management required to meet the related covenants included in the EBRD financing documents. The consultant will also assist the company to develop a medium-term focused corporate development programme and to improve the corporate planning capacity to assist its transition towards becoming a self-sustaining entity with commercially sustainable operations, as well as implementation of the Environmental and social action plan (“ESAP”) developed for the company.</P><P>Part II: Stakeholder participation programme</P><P>The second objective is to develop and implement a Stakeholders participation programme (“SPP”), aimed at enhancing public ownership by encouraging the use of public transport, increasing public participation in the provision of public transport services (service quality and rehabilitation activities) and raising public awareness on issues related to project implementation. The SPP should be designed in a way that it ensures meaningful participation of all concerned stakeholders, men and women alike, in the consultation.</P><P>The selected consultant is expected to provide the following services:</P><P>1. Prepare a financial and operational performance improvement programme (“FOPIP”) for the company, which will focus on ensuring that they meet the covenants set forth in the financing documentation with EBRD. These include:</P><P>— Maintaining satisfactory accounting, cost control and management information systems and books of account in accordance with international accounting standards starting from a date to be agreed with the bank in the loan agreement (this requires support in converting existing financial reports in an IAS type format),</P><P>— Developing internal documentation for the management processes, standard operating procedures, job descriptions for the company staff,</P><P>— Maintaining financial covenants in the project agreements and sub-loan agreement negotiated with the government,</P><P>— Debt service coverage ratio improvement as established in the project agreements,</P><P>— Implementation of the ESAP and providing the Bank with financial and environmental/social reports as required under the project agreements,</P><P>— Agreeing on performance indicators with the City.</P><P>To this end, it is expected that the FOPIP will include both corporate development actions as well as financial and operational improvements.</P><P>2.

To this end, the consultant will assist the company to develop procedures and systems to build a corporate planning process into the existing budget and business planning processes. The consultant will also identify other areas of management, finance and operations that should be considered in future corporate development plans, depending upon the progress made by the company.</P><P>4. Capacity building of the staff in the company will be a key part of the consultant’s work. Throughout the assignment, the consultant will improve the capacity of the company’s staff through on-the-job assistance and close collaboration. The consultant will arrange formal training aimed at senior and middle-level managers in all aspects of utility management, so as to enable the Company to implement the FOPIP effectively.

This forum will also be facilitated by the consultant. The City and the company will participate in the FoPTC, which will expose them to the importance of consumer participation in decision-making and problem-identification in order to have a successful and sustainable public transport supply system.
