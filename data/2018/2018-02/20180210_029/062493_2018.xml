               <P>The projects let under the Framework Agreement may be of a new-build nature, including: demolition, development, refurbishment or re-modelling of existing properties owned and / or used by the framework users, modular or a combination of all these aspects inclusive of any site related and external works.</P>
               <P>The North West Construction Hub (NWCH) wishes to transform the manner in which projects are procured and managed within the North West Region. The NWCH will adopt the principles of partnering through the development of longer term relationships through the supply chain, integrated design and construction teams, shared risk/rewards and performance management. The framework is intended to be used by Manchester City Council trading as the North West Construction Hub, and other North West local authorities but such other bodies as are referred and/or identified below may use and access the framework and each of such bodies may enter into individual call off contracts pursuant to the framework. Applications are invited from suitably experienced and capable providers of construction services who can provide high quality building construction works adopting Constructing Excellence principles and including early contractor involvement when required. Companies should be committed to partnering including working with clients and their partners, shared problem solving and continuous improvement. Call off contracts under the framework agreements will be entered into directly by the framework users and the service providers. There will be no obligation on either NWCH or any of the prospective framework users to enter into call off contracts with the service providers appointed nor will any guarantee be given as to the quantity or regularity of call off contracts to be made.</P>
               <P>Prospective framework users are those listed in the Request to Participate Information and Instructions document which can be downloaded from within the chest tendering portal.</P>
               <P>This is a restricted process, but any interested party may submit a request to participate.</P>
               <P>The Framework will be awarded for an initial term of 3 years with an option to extend for up to 1 additional year.</P>
