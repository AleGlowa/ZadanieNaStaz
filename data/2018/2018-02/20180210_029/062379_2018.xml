In the case of applications submitted by a consortium, these selection criteria will be applied to the consortium as a whole unless specified otherwise. The selection criteria will not be applied to natural persons and single-member companies when they are sub-contractors.</P><P>1— Economic and financial capacity of the candidate (based on item 3 of the application form). In case of candidate being a public body, equivalent information should be provided.</P><P>Legal persons:</P><P>a— The annual turnover of the candidate must be of at least 1 000 000 EUR for each of the last three years for which accounts have been closed.</P><P>Note to candidates: In the application form, please make sure to include the actual year for which the data is provided</P><P>2— Professional capacity of the candidate (based on items 4 and 5 of the application form). The reference period which will be taken into account will be the last three years from submission deadline.</P><P>Legal persons:</P><P>a— The number of the permanent staff of the candidate (individual company or consortium overall) currently working in fields related to this contract (as they are described in item 7 – “Contract Description” above), must be at least 10 for each of the last 3 (2015, 2016, 2017).</P><P>Note to candidates: In the application form, please make sure to include the actual year for which the data is provided.</P><P>3— Technical capacity of the candidate (based on items 5 and 6 of the application form). The reference period which will be taken into account will be the last three years from submission deadline.</P><P>Legal persons:</P><P>a— The candidate (individual company or consortium altogether) has implemented, during the last 5 years (January 2013 up to the deadline for the receipt of applications indicated under item 23 below), at least 3 projects of a minimum value of 200 000 EUR equivalent, with activities related to studies or surveys concerning integrated waste management and should demonstrate that it had a participation of minimum 50 % in each of the project(s) brought as reference.</P><P>b— The candidate (individual company or consortium altogether) has implemented, during the last 5 years (January 2013 up to the deadline for the receipt of applications indicated under item 23 below), at least 2 projects of a minimum value of 500 000 EUR equivalent, with activities related to the support of local authorities in implementing integrated waste management projects and should demonstrate that it had a participation of minimum 50 % in each of the project(s) brought as reference.</P><P>Note to candidates: the projects referenced must have been completed within the reference period (although started earlier). The tenderer may refer to a part of a project /service contract which is not yet completed, but only in so far as that part is successfully completed and its date of completion, its value, and tenderer’s % contribution may be clearly identified and proven through adequate documentary evidence (such as certificates from the beneficiary). Where the projects referenced have been implemented by consortia comprising 2 or more of the members now associated as a consortium for this tender procedure, their respective percentages shall be added together, in order for the application to be assessed on the basis of the consortium as a whole.</P><P>Previous experience which caused breach of contract and termination by a contracting authority shall not be used as reference.</P><P>With regard to criteria relating to economic and financial standing and to criteria relating to technical and professional ability, an economic operator could, where appropriate and for a particular contract, rely on the capacities of other entities, regardless of the legal nature of the links which it has with them.</P><P>If the tenderer relies on the capacities of other entities, it must, in that case, prove to the contracting authority that it will have at its disposal the resources necessary for performance of the contract, for example by producing a commitment (refer to the letter of undertaking template) on the part of those entities to place those resources at its disposal. Such entities, for instance the parent company of the economic operator, must respect the same rules of eligibility - notably that of nationality – and must fulfil the same relevant selection criteria as the economic operator. The contracting authority shall verify whether there are grounds for exclusion. The contracting authority shall require that the economic operator replaces an entity which does not meet a relevant selection criterion, or in respect of which there are compulsory grounds for exclusion. The contracting authority may require that the economic operator substitutes an entity in respect of which there are non-compulsory grounds for exclusion. With regard to educational and professional criteria, an economic operator may only rely on the capacities of other entities where the latter will perform the services for which these capacities are required.

In the case of applications submitted by a consortium, these selection criteria will be applied to the consortium as a whole unless specified otherwise. The selection criteria will not be applied to natural persons and single-member companies when they are sub-contractors.</P><P>1— Economic and financial capacity of the candidate (based on item 3 of the application form). In case of candidate being a public body, equivalent information should be provided.</P><P>Legal persons:</P><P>a— The annual turnover of the candidate must be of at least 1 000 000 EUR for each of the last three years for which accounts have been closed.</P><P>Note to candidates: In the application form, please make sure to include the actual year for which the data is provided</P><P>2— Professional capacity of the candidate (based on items 4 and 5 of the application form).

The tenderer may refer to a part of a project /service contract which is not yet completed, but only in so far as that part is successfully completed and its date of completion, its value, and tenderer’s % contribution may be clearly identified and proven through adequate documentary evidence (such as certificates from the beneficiary).

Such entities, for instance the parent company of the economic operator, must respect the same rules of eligibility - notably that of nationality – and must fulfil the same relevant selection criteria as the economic operator. The contracting authority shall verify whether there are grounds for exclusion. The contracting authority shall require that the economic operator replaces an entity which does not meet a relevant selection criterion, or in respect of which there are compulsory grounds for exclusion. The contracting authority may require that the economic operator substitutes an entity in respect of which there are non-compulsory grounds for exclusion. With regard to educational and professional criteria, an economic operator may only rely on the capacities of other entities where the latter will perform the services for which these capacities are required. With regard to economic and financial criteria, the entities upon whose capacity the tenderer relies become jointly liable for the execution of the contract.</P><P>If more than 8 eligible candidates meet the above selection criteria, the relative strengths and weaknesses of the applications of these candidates must be re-examined to identify the eight best candidates.

In case of candidate being a public body, equivalent information should be provided.</P><P>Legal persons:</P><P>a— The annual turnover of the candidate must be of at least 1 000 000 EUR for each of the last three years for which accounts have been closed.</P><P>Note to candidates: In the application form, please make sure to include the actual year for which the data is provided</P><P>2— Professional capacity of the candidate (based on items 4 and 5 of the application form).

The tenderer may refer to a part of a project /service contract which is not yet completed, but only in so far as that part is successfully completed and its date of completion, its value, and tenderer’s % contribution may be clearly identified and proven through adequate documentary evidence (such as certificates from the beneficiary).

Such entities, for instance the parent company of the economic operator, must respect the same rules of eligibility - notably that of nationality – and must fulfil the same relevant selection criteria as the economic operator. The contracting authority shall verify whether there are grounds for exclusion. The contracting authority shall require that the economic operator replaces an entity which does not meet a relevant selection criterion, or in respect of which there are compulsory grounds for exclusion. The contracting authority may require that the economic operator substitutes an entity in respect of which there are non-compulsory grounds for exclusion. With regard to educational and professional criteria, an economic operator may only rely on the capacities of other entities where the latter will perform the services for which these capacities are required. With regard to economic and financial criteria, the entities upon whose capacity the tenderer relies become jointly liable for the execution of the contract.</P><P>If more than 8 eligible candidates meet the above selection criteria, the relative strengths and weaknesses of the applications of these candidates must be re-examined to identify the eight best candidates.

In case of candidate being a public body, equivalent information should be provided.</P><P>Legal persons:</P><P>a— The annual turnover of the candidate must be of at least 1 000 000 EUR for each of the last three years for which accounts have been closed.</P><P>Note to candidates: In the application form, please make sure to include the actual year for which the data is provided</P><P>2— Professional capacity of the candidate (based on items 4 and 5 of the application form).

The tenderer may refer to a part of a project /service contract which is not yet completed, but only in so far as that part is successfully completed and its date of completion, its value, and tenderer’s % contribution may be clearly identified and proven through adequate documentary evidence (such as certificates from the beneficiary).

Such entities, for instance the parent company of the economic operator, must respect the same rules of eligibility - notably that of nationality – and must fulfil the same relevant selection criteria as the economic operator. The contracting authority shall verify whether there are grounds for exclusion. The contracting authority shall require that the economic operator replaces an entity which does not meet a relevant selection criterion, or in respect of which there are compulsory grounds for exclusion. The contracting authority may require that the economic operator substitutes an entity in respect of which there are non-compulsory grounds for exclusion. With regard to educational and professional criteria, an economic operator may only rely on the capacities of other entities where the latter will perform the services for which these capacities are required. With regard to economic and financial criteria, the entities upon whose capacity the tenderer relies become jointly liable for the execution of the contract.</P><P>If more than 8 eligible candidates meet the above selection criteria, the relative strengths and weaknesses of the applications of these candidates must be re-examined to identify the eight best candidates.

In case of candidate being a public body, equivalent information should be provided.</P><P>Legal persons:</P><P>a— The annual turnover of the candidate must be of at least 1 000 000 EUR for each of the last three years for which accounts have been closed.</P><P>Note to candidates: In the application form, please make sure to include the actual year for which the data is provided</P><P>2— Professional capacity of the candidate (based on items 4 and 5 of the application form).

The tenderer may refer to a part of a project /service contract which is not yet completed, but only in so far as that part is successfully completed and its date of completion, its value, and tenderer’s % contribution may be clearly identified and proven through adequate documentary evidence (such as certificates from the beneficiary).

Such entities, for instance the parent company of the economic operator, must respect the same rules of eligibility - notably that of nationality – and must fulfil the same relevant selection criteria as the economic operator. The contracting authority shall verify whether there are grounds for exclusion. The contracting authority shall require that the economic operator replaces an entity which does not meet a relevant selection criterion, or in respect of which there are compulsory grounds for exclusion. The contracting authority may require that the economic operator substitutes an entity in respect of which there are non-compulsory grounds for exclusion. With regard to educational and professional criteria, an economic operator may only rely on the capacities of other entities where the latter will perform the services for which these capacities are required. With regard to economic and financial criteria, the entities upon whose capacity the tenderer relies become jointly liable for the execution of the contract.</P><P>If more than 8 eligible candidates meet the above selection criteria, the relative strengths and weaknesses of the applications of these candidates must be re-examined to identify the eight best candidates.

In case of candidate being a public body, equivalent information should be provided.</P><P>Legal persons:</P><P>a— The annual turnover of the candidate must be of at least 1 000 000 EUR for each of the last three years for which accounts have been closed.</P><P>Note to candidates: In the application form, please make sure to include the actual year for which the data is provided</P><P>2— Professional capacity of the candidate (based on items 4 and 5 of the application form).

The tenderer may refer to a part of a project /service contract which is not yet completed, but only in so far as that part is successfully completed and its date of completion, its value, and tenderer’s % contribution may be clearly identified and proven through adequate documentary evidence (such as certificates from the beneficiary).

Such entities, for instance the parent company of the economic operator, must respect the same rules of eligibility - notably that of nationality – and must fulfil the same relevant selection criteria as the economic operator. The contracting authority shall verify whether there are grounds for exclusion. The contracting authority shall require that the economic operator replaces an entity which does not meet a relevant selection criterion, or in respect of which there are compulsory grounds for exclusion. The contracting authority may require that the economic operator substitutes an entity in respect of which there are non-compulsory grounds for exclusion. With regard to educational and professional criteria, an economic operator may only rely on the capacities of other entities where the latter will perform the services for which these capacities are required. With regard to economic and financial criteria, the entities upon whose capacity the tenderer relies become jointly liable for the execution of the contract.</P><P>If more than 8 eligible candidates meet the above selection criteria, the relative strengths and weaknesses of the applications of these candidates must be re-examined to identify the eight best candidates.

In case of candidate being a public body, equivalent information should be provided.</P><P>Legal persons:</P><P>a— The annual turnover of the candidate must be of at least 1 000 000 EUR for each of the last three years for which accounts have been closed.</P><P>Note to candidates: In the application form, please make sure to include the actual year for which the data is provided</P><P>2— Professional capacity of the candidate (based on items 4 and 5 of the application form).

The tenderer may refer to a part of a project /service contract which is not yet completed, but only in so far as that part is successfully completed and its date of completion, its value, and tenderer’s % contribution may be clearly identified and proven through adequate documentary evidence (such as certificates from the beneficiary).

Such entities, for instance the parent company of the economic operator, must respect the same rules of eligibility - notably that of nationality – and must fulfil the same relevant selection criteria as the economic operator. The contracting authority shall verify whether there are grounds for exclusion. The contracting authority shall require that the economic operator replaces an entity which does not meet a relevant selection criterion, or in respect of which there are compulsory grounds for exclusion. The contracting authority may require that the economic operator substitutes an entity in respect of which there are non-compulsory grounds for exclusion. With regard to educational and professional criteria, an economic operator may only rely on the capacities of other entities where the latter will perform the services for which these capacities are required. With regard to economic and financial criteria, the entities upon whose capacity the tenderer relies become jointly liable for the execution of the contract.</P><P>If more than 8 eligible candidates meet the above selection criteria, the relative strengths and weaknesses of the applications of these candidates must be re-examined to identify the eight best candidates.

In case of candidate being a public body, equivalent information should be provided.</P><P>Legal persons:</P><P>a— The annual turnover of the candidate must be of at least 1 000 000 EUR for each of the last three years for which accounts have been closed.</P><P>Note to candidates: In the application form, please make sure to include the actual year for which the data is provided</P><P>2— Professional capacity of the candidate (based on items 4 and 5 of the application form).

The tenderer may refer to a part of a project /service contract which is not yet completed, but only in so far as that part is successfully completed and its date of completion, its value, and tenderer’s % contribution may be clearly identified and proven through adequate documentary evidence (such as certificates from the beneficiary).

Such entities, for instance the parent company of the economic operator, must respect the same rules of eligibility - notably that of nationality – and must fulfil the same relevant selection criteria as the economic operator. The contracting authority shall verify whether there are grounds for exclusion. The contracting authority shall require that the economic operator replaces an entity which does not meet a relevant selection criterion, or in respect of which there are compulsory grounds for exclusion. The contracting authority may require that the economic operator substitutes an entity in respect of which there are non-compulsory grounds for exclusion. With regard to educational and professional criteria, an economic operator may only rely on the capacities of other entities where the latter will perform the services for which these capacities are required. With regard to economic and financial criteria, the entities upon whose capacity the tenderer relies become jointly liable for the execution of the contract.</P><P>If more than 8 eligible candidates meet the above selection criteria, the relative strengths and weaknesses of the applications of these candidates must be re-examined to identify the eight best candidates.

Such entities, for instance the parent company of the economic operator, must respect the same rules of eligibility - notably that of nationality – and must fulfil the same relevant selection criteria as the economic operator. The contracting authority shall verify whether there are grounds for exclusion. The contracting authority shall require that the economic operator replaces an entity which does not meet a relevant selection criterion, or in respect of which there are compulsory grounds for exclusion. The contracting authority may require that the economic operator substitutes an entity in respect of which there are non-compulsory grounds for exclusion. With regard to educational and professional criteria, an economic operator may only rely on the capacities of other entities where the latter will perform the services for which these capacities are required. With regard to economic and financial criteria, the entities upon whose capacity the tenderer relies become jointly liable for the execution of the contract.</P><P>If more than 8 eligible candidates meet the above selection criteria, the relative strengths and weaknesses of the applications of these candidates must be re-examined to identify the eight best candidates.
