               <P>The meaning of “local time” is Central European Winter Time (CET).</P>
               <P>Any legal entity may only submit one tender. The tender and the ESPD shall be submitted electronically using the web-based tendering system provided by Kammeradvokaten (The Legal Advisor to the Danish state) following the instructions in the tender document. Tenders cannot be submitted using any other means. The tendering system can be accessed using the link set out in section I.3. If not already registered in the system access to the tender documents can be obtained by registering using the link ‘Online registration’. The ESPD is completed in EU Supply where the tenderer is to export the XML file, complete it, save it locally as a PDF and import it using the function under the headline "ESPD" under "My Response". It is the responsibility of the tenderer to keep informed of questions and answers and any addenda and/or clarification published in the system in respect of this tender.</P>
               <P>The embassy shall exclude a tenderer from participation in the procurement procedure where it has established that the tenderer is covered by the exclusion grounds listed in the Danish Public Procurement Act, (Udbudsloven) §135 and §136 (EU Directive 2014/24/EU, article 57(1)-(3), and article 57 (4)(e),(f) and (h).) (i.e. Grounds relating to criminal convictions, grounds relating to the payment of taxes or social security contributions, grounds relating to conflicts of interests or distortion of competition from the prior involvement of the economic operators in the preparation of the procurement procedure, if this cannot be remedied by other, less intrusive measures, guilty of serious misrepresentation of information).</P>
               <P>The embassy will exclude a tenderer from the procurement procedure if the tenderer is in a situation covered by the Danish Public Procurement Act §137, stk. 1, no. 2. (EU Directive 2014/24/EU, article 57 (4) (b).) (i.e. Grounds relating to insolvency). Before award of contract, the embassy will require that the tenderer to whom it intends to award the contract presents documentation for the claims given in the ESPD proving the absence of grounds for exclusion, as stipulated in the Danish Public Procurement Act §135, stk. 1 and 3, and §137 stk. 1, no. 2. (EU Directive 2014/24/EU, article 57 (1), article 57 (2), and article 57 (4)(b)) (i.e. Grounds relating to criminal convictions, the payment of taxes or social security contributions and grounds relating to insolvency).</P>
               <P>For Danish tenderers documentation can be in the form of a “service attest”. Entities from other EU member states may identify the relevant certificate(s) using the online platform e-Certis to the extent this has been updated. Where the country in question does not issue such documents or certificates, or where these do not cover all the cases specified, they may be replaced by a declaration on oath or, in countries where there is no provision for declarations on oath, by a solemn declaration made by the person concerned before a competent judicial or administrative authority, a notary or a competent professional or trade body, in the country of origin or in the country where the economic operator is established.</P>
               <P>The embassy reserves the right — but is not obliged — to use the remedies provided for in the Danish Public Procurement Act, §159, stk. 5, if applications or tenders do not fulfil the formalities of the tender documents. (EU Directive 2014/24/EU, article 56 (3)).</P>
               <P>Rationale for not splitting the contract up into lots (cf. Danish Public Procurement Act §49, stk. 2): This contract has not been split into lots due to market and economic considerations. The size and character of the services to be provided makes it unsuitable for distributing over several lots.</P>
               <P>The Embassy opposes exclusive agreements with sub-consultants, be they organisations or individuals.</P>
