The award decision notice will specify the criteria for the award of the framework agreement, the reasons for the decision, including the characteristics and relative advantages, the name and score of the successful tender; and will specify when the standstill period is expected to end or the date before which the Contracting Authority will not conclude the framework agreement. If an appeal regarding the award of a contract has not been successfully resolved, the Public Contracts Regulations 2006, as amended by the Public Contracts (Amendment) Regulations 2009 and the Public Procurement (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2011, set out the time frame within which aggrieved parties who have been harmed or are at risk of a breach of the rules may take action in the High Court (England, Wales and Northern Ireland). Any such action must be brought within 30 days from the date when the economic operator in question first knew or ought to have known that grounds for the bringing of proceedings had arisen. The Court may extend the 30 day period in a particular case if it considers that there is good reason for so doing, up to a period of 3 months from the actual or deemed date of knowledge of the economic operator. The Court may order the setting aside of the award decision or may order the Contracting Authority to amend any document and may award damages. If the framework agreement has been entered into the Court may make a declaration of ineffectiveness or may order that the duration of any relevant specific contract be shortened and additionally may award damages. The time limit for seeking such a declaration is generally 30 days from notification of the award (either by award decision notification or contract award notice depending on the circumstances) or otherwise 6 months.</P></LODGING_OF_APPEALS_PRECISION></LODGING_OF_APPEALS></PROCEDURES_FOR_APPEAL><NOTICE_DISPATCH_DATE><DAY>16</DAY><MONTH>02</MONTH><YEAR>2018</YEAR></NOTICE_DISPATCH_DATE></COMPLEMENTARY_INFORMATION_CONTRACT_NOTICE></FD_CONTRACT></CONTRACT></FORM_SECTION></TED_EXPORT>
