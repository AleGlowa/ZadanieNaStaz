                  <P>Digital spatial representation of following sites:</P>
                  <P>Garron SAC (4652), Montiaghs Moss SAC (151), Pettigoe SAC (1268), Drunragh/ Pettigo Plateau SAC (2079), Meentygranagh SAC (530), Croaghonagh Bog (249), Lough Nillan Bog (Carrickatlieve) SAC (4160). Total 12938 ha.</P>
                  <P>Mapping must comply with:</P>
                  <P>Stage 1 — Site description:</P>
                  <P>A digital spatial representation of what is present — spatially representing vegetation cover using Phase 1 Habitat Survey (JNCC, 2003) to give a basic overview of habitats — please use Phase 1 codes rather than written description. Any mapping classification types will need to integrate with other national mapping systems e.g. Fossit, Phase 1: National Vegetation Classification and also larger scale mapping derived using spectral analysis of EO data. At the appropriate scale for management decision making, mapping must allow discrimination of EU Annex 1 habitat types and as part of producing INSPIRE compliant data, must adhere to the requirements of the EU Nature Information System (EUNIS). Spatial data must be compliant with the EU INSPIRE Directive.</P>
                  <P>Stage 2 — Feature mapping:</P>
                  <P>Describing and spatially representing the special interest features of that site using Annex 1 Habitats of the Habitats Directive. This stage will be derived from Stage 1 with the addition of ancillary information, analysis of land cover, capture of present and historic management and other data/knowledge. CABB Project Officers, who are writing Conservation Action Plans, will build on this information and will be able to build new layers showing proposed management recommendations for the site.</P>
                  <P>Stage 3 — Transcription to EUNIS:</P>
                  <P>The Phase 1/NVC data must be transcribed into the EUNIS habitat classification system and formated according to the EMODnet Seabed Habitats Translated Habitat Data Exchange Format to enable extraction of data related to priority habitats such as Habitats Directive Annex I habitats and OSPAR threatened and/or declining habitats.</P>
                  <P>More detail on the mapping required can be found in Annex 1 “Designated Sites Habitat Mapping Guidance for Northern Ireland”.</P>
                  <P>Note:</P>
                  <P>a. When mapping scrub please identify if the scrub is Mature/Established or Young/Actively Encroaching to assist in management considerations.</P>
                  <P>b. All land cover polygons must have a defined spatial resolution and also standard error of primary attribution.</P>
                  <P>c. Interoperability — The shape files developed should be interoperable with the spatial data/GIS within government in the eligible region (Northern Ireland, Scotland and Ireland) and the EU. The shape files and their attributable data should also be provided in spreadsheets.</P>
                  <P>d. Spatial resolution of the final product needs to be appropriate to the needs of the ultimate use of the data, which, for the most part will be directing/targeting conservation actions at site or compartment level. In some instances, standardised minimal mapping may be appropriate for features of low ecological interest or non-vegetative areas such as roads. EUNIS codes can be used for this purpose.</P>
                  <P>e. Where possible it is expected that homogenous habitat or land cover stands will be mapped but there will be occasions where this is not practical.</P>
                  <P>f. To adequately address management measures or factors external to Natura 2000 sites, mapping will be required not only within designated site boundaries but also adjoining areas that can influence the N2K site. Mapping carried out will need to take into account the features that may impact upon the features of the N2K site. Suppliers will be expected to highlight how they will capture this non N2K site data in their tender.</P>
                  <P>g. In Ireland, baseline habitat survey and mapping should use the system in the Guide to Habitats (Fossitt) and should also map the Annex 1 the Habitats Directive habitat types where present.

Any mapping classification types will need to integrate with other national mapping systems e.g. Fossit, Phase 1: National Vegetation Classification and also larger scale mapping derived using spectral analysis of EO data. At the appropriate scale for management decision making, mapping must allow discrimination of EU Annex 1 habitat types and as part of producing INSPIRE compliant data, must adhere to the requirements of the EU Nature Information System (EUNIS). Spatial data must be compliant with the EU INSPIRE Directive.</P>
                  <P>b. Stage 2 — Feature mapping:</P>
                  <P>Describing and spatially representing the special interest features of that site using Annex 1 Habitats of the Habitats Directive. This stage will be derived from stage 1 with the addition of ancillary information, analysis of land cover, capture of present and historic management and other data/knowledge. CABB Project Officers, who are writing Conservation Action Plans, will build on this information and will be able to build new layers showing proposed management recommendations for the site.</P>
                  <P>c. Stage 3 — Transcription to EUNIS</P>
                  <P>The Phase 1/NVC data must be transcribed into the EUNIS habitat classification system and formated according to the EMODnet Seabed Habitats Translated Habitat Data Exchange Format to enable extraction of data related to priority habitats such as Habitats Directive Annex I habitats and OSPAR threatened and/or declining habitats.</P>
                  <P>More detail on the mapping required can be found in Annex 1 “Designated Sites Habitat Mapping Guidance for Northern Ireland”.</P>

                  <P>c.

                  <P>e. Where possible it is expected that homogenous habitat or land cover stands will be mapped but there will be occasions where this is not practical.</P>

                  <P>Digital mapping will need to comply with the following stages:</P>
                  <P>a. Stage 1 — Site description:</P>
                  <P>A digital spatial representation of what is present on the site — spatially representing vegetation cover using Phase 1 Habitat Survey (JNCC, 2003) to give a basic overview of habitats - please use Phase 1 codes rather than written description. Any mapping classification types will need to integrate with other national mapping systems e.g. Fossit, Phase 1: National Vegetation Classification and also larger scale mapping derived using spectral analysis of EO data. At the appropriate scale for management decision making, mapping must allow discrimination of EU Annex 1 habitat types and as part of producing INSPIRE compliant data, must adhere to the requirements of the EU Nature Information System (EUNIS). Spatial data must be compliant with the EU INSPIRE Directive.</P>
                  <P>b. Stage 2 — Feature mapping:</P>
                  <P>Describing and spatially representing the special interest features of that site using Annex 1 Habitats of the Habitats Directive. This stage will be derived from stage 1 with the addition of ancillary information, analysis of land cover, capture of present and historic management and other data/knowledge. CABB Project Officers, who are writing Conservation Action Plans, will build on this information and will be able to build new layers showing proposed management recommendations for the site.</P>
                  <P>c. Stage 3 — Transcription to EUNIS:</P>
                  <P>The Phase 1/NVC data must be transcribed into the EUNIS habitat classification system and formated according to the EMODnet Seabed Habitats Translated Habitat Data Exchange Format to enable extraction of data related to priority habitats such as Habitats Directive Annex I habitats and OSPAR threatened and/or declining habitats.</P>
                  <P>More detail on the mapping required can be found in Annex 1 “Designated Sites Habitat Mapping Guidance for Northern Ireland”.</P>
