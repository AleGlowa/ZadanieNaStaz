               <SHORT_DESCR>
                  <P>Reading Borough Council requires a provider to deliver an outreach service to those who are rough sleeping.</P>
                  <P>The service will:</P>
                  <P>— Provide staffing capacity to support a minimum of 40 found and a minimum of 25 reported rough sleepers at any given time.</P>
                  <P>— Intervene early with people who are new to the streets using a No Second Night Out (NSNO) model of delivery, enabling clients to access sit-up and emergency bed spaces within Reading’s intensive and engaging support hub to prevent longer term and entrenched rough sleeping behaviours.</P>
                  <P>— Assist entrenched rough sleepers, to include those with severe and multiple needs, to improve their current situation by using MEAM principles to prepare individuals to access accommodation services. This will include the Housing First model, physical and/or mental health treatment and/or beginning to engage with harm reduction and other relevant services that will move them away from a street-based lifestyle.</P>
                  <P>— Deliver a housing first model through the social rented and private rented sector for between eight and 10 individuals.</P>
                  <P>— Co-locate with the intensive and engaging support hub.</P>
                  <P>— Support the Hub to deliver comprehensive and holistic services to rough sleepers.</P>
                  <P>Accommodation options for rough sleeper outreach service.</P>
