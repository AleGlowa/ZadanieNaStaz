               <P>Innovate UK is establishing a Dynamic purchasing system (DPS) as a means of awarding contracts for monitoring services.</P>
               <P>Innovate UK provides grant funding to individuals and organisations involved in developing technology and science innovations. It is vital for Innovate UK that the performance and progress of publicly funded projects are monitored to ensure that the funding is used properly and effectively.</P>
               <P>The DPS is divided into a number of Lots based on the different areas of innovation to which the innovation projects relate. The DPS is a completely electronic tendering system through which Monitoring services providers (MSPs) can apply to be admitted to a specific Lot. Interested parties must specify which Lots they are applying to join. Admission to a Lot or Lots is no guarantee of work, but innovate UK's intention would be to invite tenders from MSPs within Lots for future Monitoring services opportunities.</P>
               <P>MSPs can apply to join the DPS at any time in the life of the DPS.</P>

                  <P>Batteries for future electrified vehicles are recognised as a major global opportunity for the UK. Around 50 % of the value of future vehicles will be related to the battery and its supporting systems. Future investment decisions around battery development and their manufacture in the UK will likely influence significant wider investment decisions by OEMs, including vehicle production. The complete supply chain for batteries at scale for the automotive sector does not yet fully exist, representing an opportunity for the UK.</P>

                  <P>As guidance this General and Disruptive Vehicles Lot is comprised of projects funded to support new and highly disruptive technologies within the UK automotive sector. Projects within this Lot will:</P>
                  <P>-.</P>
                  <P>Be centred around new and highly disruptive technologies (and deployment of such technologies) within the automotive sector.</P>
                  <P>-.</P>
                  <P>Require integration with existing and future vehicles across a variety of vehicle categories.</P>
                  <P>-.</P>
                  <P>Need a business case to support progress towards commercialisation.</P>
                  <P>The drive towards zero emissions by 2040 is creating a once in a generation change in the automotive supply chain and ensuring UK companies are positioned to take advantage of this change is a key focus for government.</P>

                  <P>This Monitoring Support Service (MSS) Lot is designed specifically to provide short-term support to a Monitoring Officer already placed in position by a MSP, on behalf of the Innovate UK Monitoring Team. For absolute clarity, there is no part of this role which is intended in any way to replace the monitoring service being provided by that MO/MSP. The Support Service is fundamentally additional and responsive. It will be procured under any of the following circumstances:</P>
                  <P>— A need is identified to provide experienced moderation advice/guidance to an existing Project/MO or both (e.g. where eligibility issues arise),</P>
                  <P>— A need is identified to provide Quality Assurance (QA) support/guidance to an existing Project/MO or both (e.g. for reports prepared by the Monitoring Officer and LPM),</P>
                  <P>— Innovate UK Operations wishes to undertake portfolio analysis requiring inter-Project discussions,</P>
                  <P>— A need is identified to conduct investigation into Project conduct which requires the provision of support, advice or guidance to the incumbent MO,</P>
                  <P>— In the event of a deterioration or breakdown in the relationship between a Project and its MO, Innovate UK’s Monitoring Team will provide expert and experienced Monitoring support in an effort to retrieve the situation and avoid more formal measures.</P>

               <P>About Innovate UK and UKRI.</P>
               <P>Innovate UK is the UK’s innovation agency. We are an executive non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) and are incorporated as the Technology strategy board by royal charter in England and Wales.</P>
               <P>In April 2018 changes will be made to the structure of the UK's research and innovation bodies (including Innovate UK). A new body corporate will be established under the Higher Education and Research Act 2017 that brings together the UK's seven Research Councils, Innovate UK and a new organisation, Research England. This new body will be known as UK Research and Innovation ("UKRI").</P>
               <P>With the establishment of UKRI, Innovate UK (Technology Strategy Board) will cease to exist as a body corporate in its own right and will become a committee or 'Council' of UKRI. Innovate UK will continue to administer contract and grant funding and to manage the relationship with MSPs as a Council of UKRI. However, existing contracts awarded by innovate UK under the DPS will be transferred to UKRI under a statutory transfer scheme and future contracts awarded under the DPS will be entered into by UKRI. More information about UKRI is available from www.ukri.org applications and expressions of interest. The DPS is a completely electronic tendering system through which Monitoring services providers can apply to be admitted to a specific Lot of Monitoring services providers. To participate in this procurement, participants must first register online to the DPS Portal at this URL: https://supplierlive.proactisp2p.com/account/login?cid=INNOVATEUK</P>
               <P>Please note that, to register, participants (also referred to as applicants or bidders) must have a valid DUNS number (as provided by Dun and Bradstreet) for the organisation which you are registering, who will be entering into a contract if invited to do so. Note: registration may take some time please ensure that you allow a sufficient amount of time to register.</P>
               <P>Full instructions for registration and use of the system can be found at https://supplierlive.proactisp2p.com/account/login?cid=INNOVATEUK</P>
               <P>Once you have registered on the DPS Portal, a registered user can review all DPS Documentation and express an interest for a specific Lot (or Lots).</P>
               <P>The DPS is divided into a number of Lots (48) based on the different areas of innovation to which the innovation projects relate. Interested parties must specify which Lots they are applying to join. Admission to a Lot or Lots within the DPS is no guarantee of work, but Innovate UK's intention would be to invite tenders from those Monitoring services providers within Lots for future Monitoring services opportunities.</P>
               <P>Monitoring services providers can apply to join the DPS at any time in the life of the DPS and those meeting the selection criteria will be admitted to the DPS.</P>
               <P>As a user of the DPS Portal you will have access to the DPS Portal’s email messaging service which facilitates all messages sent to you and from you in relation to the DPS.</P>
