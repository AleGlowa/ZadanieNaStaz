                  <P>It is envisaged that the services can be provided remotely at the organisations offices with attendance required on an ad-hoc basis at Transport Scotland’s offices. However, on occasion, the provider may be required to undertake the following duties:</P>
                  <P>i. attend the offices, construction sites or other location within the UK as and when required;</P>
                  <P>ii. attend meetings at Transport Scotland’s main office in Buchanan House, Glasgow or site offices as and when may be required;</P>
                  <P>iii. liaison with other Transport Scotland advisers/ consultants/ contractors as required.</P>
                  <P>The Framework participants will be procured through a competitive tender procedure, in accordance with the restricted procedure as provided for in the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2015. The Framework Agreement will be for a period of 4 years. Contracts called off the framework will be of varying length depending on individual project requirements. This contract will not be divided into lots as this would make the service unreasonably complex to administer in that manner.</P>
                  <P>To be considered for this Contract, Economic Operators are required to complete the European Single Procurement Document (ESPD) in accordance with this Contract Notice. Economic Operators shall be evaluated in accordance with the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2015, on the basis of information they have provided within the ESPD.</P>

               <P>Each selected Economic Operator shall be invited to submit a Tender on the same contract terms.</P>
               <P>The Framework Agreement will be based on an NEC4 Framework and professional services contract with bespoke amendments.</P>
               <P>These amendments may arise from three basic considerations:</P>
               <P>(i) amendments to reflect the Scottish Ministers' particular requirements and risk allocation for this agreement;</P>
               <P>(ii) amendments to reflect Scots law; and</P>
