It employs approximately 6700 staff at EPO headquarters in Munich, a branch at The Hague/Rijswijk (NL) and sub-offices in Berlin and Vienna (the number of member states and staff members indicated may change).</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="002"><NO_MARK>2.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Award procedure:</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>International open invitation to tender with discretionary award of contract.</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="003"><NO_MARK>3.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Description of the contract:</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>(a) Purpose of the contract:</P><P>The provision of translation services to be performed at the contractor's premises.
