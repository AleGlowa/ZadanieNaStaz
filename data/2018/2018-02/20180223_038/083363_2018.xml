                  <P>The services covered by this procurement exercise have been subdivided into Lots, where we are seeking individual programmes to strengthen collaborations between innovative businesses from each of these countries, and business from the UK:</P>

                  <P>For each Lot, we would like a Supplier to design and deliver a programme that ultimately results in economic development and social welfare improvements to the identified Newton Fund country, in line with Official Development Assistance (ODA) objectives. The programme should:</P>
                  <P>1. Strengthen the innovation potential of businesses based in and from the Newton Fund country, through stimulating and supporting their collaboration with innovative UK businesses, and with the UK’s innovation ecosystem.</P>
                  <P>In particular, the programme should strengthen the ability of businesses based in and from the identified Newton Fund country, to deliver innovative solutions (new products, new services, improved business processes) to key societal and socio-economic challenges existing within that country. These challenges must be ones currently impacting the poorer, marginalised or more disadvantaged groups within that country’s population, although they may have a wider impact upon the general population of that country.</P>
                  <P>2. Also deliver benefits for UK businesses and the UK innovation ecosystem, for example in terms of an improved understanding of the innovation-driven partnership opportunities in the 4 Newton Fund countries.</P>
                  <P>What we mean by “innovation” and “strengthening the innovation potential”: we are focusing on science and technology-driven, commercially-focused innovation. This is in line with Innovate UK’s focus on and mandate of stimulating and supporting business-led innovation.</P>
                  <P>By strengthening the innovation potential, we mean working with companies to de-risk, enable and support innovation so that novel commercial solutions to key socio-economic challenges in the Newton Fund countries can emerge. These solutions may be novel because they are new to the market in Newton Fund countries, or more affordable than existing solutions, for example.</P>
                  <P>The successful Supplier or set of Suppliers will be expected to effectively design and deliver a business innovation collaboration programme that meets the objectives set out in this specification, within the agreed budget and timeline, for the Newton Fund countries identified (Egypt, Indonesia, South Africa and Turkey).</P>

                  <P>As part of Innovate UK’s Newton Fund commitments, this procurement is to identify a Supplier or set of Suppliers who can design and deliver programmes to strengthen collaborations between innovative businesses from the Newton Fund partner countries of Egypt, Indonesia, South Africa and Turkey, and innovative businesses from the UK.</P>
                  <P>The services covered by this procurement exercise have been subdivided into Lots, where we are seeking individual programmes to strengthen collaborations between innovative businesses from each of these countries, and business from the UK:</P>
                  <P>Lot 1: Egypt.</P>
                  <P>Lot 2: Indonesia.</P>
                  <P>Lot 3: South Africa.</P>
                  <P>Lot 4: Turkey.</P>
                  <P>The objective of this procurement is to identify a Supplier or set of Suppliers capable of designing and delivering programmes to stimulate and support innovation-focused collaborations between businesses from the UK and from the Newton Fund countries of Egypt, Indonesia, South Africa and Turkey.</P>
                  <P>For each Lot, we would like a Supplier to design and deliver a programme that ultimately results in economic development and social welfare improvements to the identified Newton Fund country, in line with Official Development Assistance (ODA) objectives. The programme should:</P>
                  <P>1. Strengthen the innovation potential of businesses based in and from the Newton Fund country, through stimulating and supporting their collaboration with innovative UK businesses, and with the UK’s innovation ecosystem.</P>
                  <P>In particular, the programme should strengthen the ability of businesses based in and from the identified Newton Fund country, to deliver innovative solutions (new products, new services, improved business processes) to key societal and socio-economic challenges existing within that country. These challenges must be ones currently impacting the poorer, marginalised or more disadvantaged groups within that country’s population, although they may have a wider impact upon the general population of that country.</P>
                  <P>2. Also deliver benefits for UK businesses and the UK innovation ecosystem, for example in terms of an improved understanding of the innovation-driven partnership opportunities in the 4 Newton Fund countries.</P>
                  <P>What we mean by “innovation” and “strengthening the innovation potential”:</P>
                  <P>We are focusing on science and technology-driven, commercially-focused innovation. This is in line with Innovate UK’s focus on and mandate of stimulating and supporting business-led innovation.</P>
                  <P>By strengthening the innovation potential, we mean working with companies to de-risk, enable and support innovation so that novel commercial solutions to key socio-economic challenges in the Newton Fund countries can emerge. These solutions may be novel because they are new to the market in Newton Fund countries, or more affordable than existing solutions, for example.</P>
                  <P>The successful Supplier or set of Suppliers will be expected to effectively design and deliver a business innovation collaboration programme that meets the objectives set out in this specification, within the agreed budget and timeline, for the Newton Fund countries identified (Egypt, Indonesia, South Africa and Turkey).</P>
