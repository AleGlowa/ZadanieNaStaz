               <P>Homelessness prevention has been a major aspect of the Scottish housing agenda for over a decade.</P>
               <P>Scottish Housing Options Regional Hubs, across Scotland are seeking to develop a range of support materials in the form of a “Housing Options Training Toolkit”. It is intended that this toolkit provides a range of transformational bespoke materials to support internal training delivery by HUB partners, e-learning materials or facilitated training courses as part of a tailored approach to staff development.</P>
               <P>Housing Options addresses 6 areas, which will each form discrete module deliverables, in this contract.</P>

               </MAIN_SITE>
               <SHORT_DESCR>
                  <P>The Supplier shall be required to design and build a web-based E-Learning Platform to host and facilitate access to learning by licensees across the Partnership. An initial supply of 6 000 user/learner licenses shall be provided, with the facility to purchase additional licenses in blocks of no less than 1 000 licenses at an agreed cost. Where licensing is based on concurrent user/learners, the expectation is that the maximum user/learners on at any one time could be 50 user/learners or less.</P>
                  <P>In order to maximise (i) ease of access from a user perspective and also (ii) ease of update from a development perspective; the toolkit materials require to be made available in a web-based learning solution, which enables training content to be made available on a module by module basis. The web-based solution must be capable of hosting 3 types of content material:</P>
                  <P>— trainer led materials for classroom style events,</P>
                  <P>— e-learning materials; and,</P>
                  <P>— reference/information resources.</P>
                  <P>Based on the training methodologies recommended, it is anticipated that classroom style events could be delivered locally (at local authority level and potentially in-house) or at a regional (Hub) level by a pool of accredited training providers. To this end, to enable users to access opportunities to host or attend events on a flexible basis; it would be desirable that the web-based solution delivers a calendar facility to enable partners to access the programme of activity taking place across the country. This could include users, or partners such as staff from the NHS or other related organisations.</P>
                  <P>A substantial body of materials has been assembled by the Authority from the Partnership and will be made available to the Supplier. It is intended that this material will provide the initial content to populate the selected learning solution. It is hoped that these materials will apply an initial level of consistency and quality in building toolkit content.</P>
                  <P>A robust process was followed to ensure materials submitted could be assigned specifically to identified modules and learning outcomes. The materials submitted will clearly inform the content for each of the identified topics / modules. Whilst this process has been thorough, there still remains a priority “design” element to ensure the toolkit delivers to agreed and consistent standards. This design process will involve taking the existing materials and “rebranding”, giving all materials the same style and feel. This is essential to the success of the training toolkit due to the cultural changes that staff / practitioners will experience as part of the housing options ethos.</P>
                  <P>To assist with the procurement of the Supplier the agreed modules and learning outcomes have been reviewed and the most effective training methodologies will be outlined within the full specification. There are a number of key assumptions that we have made to take into consideration when reviewing the proposed delivery methods for the toolkit.</P>
                  <P>As an additional option, it is envisaged that the lead supplier will partner with a resource capable of designing classroom sessions, within the six strands of Housing Options. Delivery is expected to be a mixture of in-house and optional lead supplier provided. A daily rate costing shall be agreed within available budgets and must be clearly stated within the costing sheet, for classroom delivery.</P>

                  <P>Score – Definition.</P>
                  <P>100 Response is completely relevant. It is unlikely that the response could be more comprehensive or be improved upon. It provides comprehensive evidence and full assurance that the candidate fully meets the required standard in this selection criterion</P>
                  <P>90 Response is almost entirely relevant. The response is comprehensive, unambiguous and demonstrates a thorough understanding of what is required in respect of this selection criterion, and provides convincing evidence of their capacity/ability/experience in this area</P>
                  <P>80 Response is highly relevant. Detailed response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the selection criterion and provides a high level of detail as to their capacity/ability/experience in this area</P>
                  <P>70 Response is relevant. The response is sufficiently detailed to demonstrate a thorough understanding of the selection criterion and provides evidence of a reliable level of capacity/ability/experience in this area</P>
                  <P>60 Response is substantially relevant and acceptable and demonstrates a broad understanding of the selection criterion to a satisfactory depth but evidence of capacity/ability/experience in this area could have been more detailed</P>
                  <P>50 Response is at least 50 % relevant and acceptable. The response demonstrates an understanding of the selection criterion but lacks detail of evidence of capacity/ability/experience in this area</P>
                  <P>40 Response is partially relevant but evidence presented is not sufficiently detailed to demonstrate a reliable level of capacity/ability/experience in this area. There is a lack of depth of detail or understanding in many areas</P>
                  <P>30 Response has some relevance but is generally insufficient. The response addresses some elements of the requirement but contains limited evidence as to the candidate’s capacity/ability/experience in this area</P>
                  <P>20 Response demonstrates a lack of understanding and little pertinent limited evidence as to the candidate’s capacity/ability/experience in this area</P>
                  <P>10 Response demonstrates little evidence of the candidate’s understanding or explanation of the candidate’s capacity/ability/experience in this area</P>
                  <P>0 Nil/irrelevant response</P>
                  <P>The following Question weightings apply: 4C.1.2 100 %; Example 1 70 %, Example 2 30 %.</P>
                  <P>Subject to achieving a pass for all minimum standards (aforementioned here in II.2.9), Bidders will be ranked by weighted score achieved against Part IV Selection Criteria, Section “C Technical and Professional Ability” Question 4C.1.2. Invitation to tender will be made to those with the highest scores.</P>
