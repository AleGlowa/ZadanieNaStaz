               <SHORT_DESCR>
                  <P>Domiciliary personal care and community enabling care provides support to Children and Young People (CYP) and their families in their home and community. The target group is CYP from birth to the end of the academic year in which they turn 19 years old in most cases; however some YP may access Adult Services contracts from the age of 18. Domiciliary Personal Care Services Element: To provide care in the home, to be supplied according to family need and following an assessment, in order to provide assistance to families who require additional help working with the child and family together. The provider(s) for this element of the services will need to be registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC). Community Enabling Care Services Element: To enable the child/young person to go out and take part in activities in the local community such as leisure, sports, clubs, interest groups, individual activities and access to the natural environment and local play facilities. Where a CYP Service User does not have personal care needs, then the provider in these circumstances will not need to be CQC registered. The approach to commissioning for this service is to award to one lead provider for each of the lots 1-4 (based on geographical areas) and also award Lot 5 (covering countywide) to a number of framework providers to pick up any additional requirements. Lots 1 to 4 — lead provider contracts lots 1 to 4 will be awarded immediately on the setting up of the framework agreement and each lot will be awarded to one lead provider. The Council will award the lead provider contracts for an initial contract period of 3 years and 8 months with an option to extend the lead provider Contracts for up to a further 2 years on an annual basis at the sole discretion of the Council. Lot 5 — additional requirements — Multi – provider services — Countywide The Council, in addition, will be awarding multiple framework providers onto lot 5, in order to meet the additional capacity of care required, across the county of Hertfordshire. Framework providers will indicate within their tender submission for this lot, which districts of Hertfordshire they will be able to provide Services within. Provider(s) may submit a tender for any/all lead provider Contracts (Lots 1-4) and/or Lot 5. The estimated total value of the Contract is stated in II.1.5 of this notice and is for the initial term inclusive of the approximate value for extensions.

                  <P>Domiciliary personal care and community enabling care provides support to Children and Young People (CYP) and their families in their home and community. The target group is CYP from birth to the end of the academic year in which they turn 19 years old in most cases; however some YP may access adult services contracts from the age of 18. Domiciliary personal care services element: To provide care in the home, to be supplied according to family need and following an assessment, in order to provide assistance to families who require additional help working with the child and family together. The provider(s) for this element of the services will need to be registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC). Community enabling care services element: To enable the child/young person to go out and take part in activities in the local community such as leisure, sports, clubs, interest groups, individual activities and access to the natural environment and local play facilities. Where a CYP Service User does not have personal care needs, then the Provider in these circumstances will not need to be CQC registered. The approach to commissioning for this Service is to award to one lead provider for each of the lots 1-4 (based on geographical areas) and also award lot 5 (covering countywide) to a number of framework providers to pick up any additional requirements. Lots 1 to 4 — lead provider contracts Lots 1 to 4 will be awarded immediately on the setting up of the framework agreement and each lot will be awarded to one lead provider. The Council will award the lead provider contracts for an initial contract period of 3 years and 8 months with an option to extend the lead provider contracts for up to a further 2 years on an annual basis at the sole discretion of the Council. Lot 5 — Additional Requirements — Multi – Provider Services — Countywide The Council, in addition, will be awarding multiple framework providers onto lot 5, in order to meet the additional capacity of care required, across the county of Hertfordshire. Framework providers will indicate within their tender submission for this Lot, which districts of Hertfordshire they will be able to provide services within. Provider(s) may submit a tender for any/all lead provider contracts (Lots 1- 4) and/or Lot 5. The estimated total value of the contract is stated in II.1.5 of this notice and is for the initial term inclusive of the approximate value for extensions. For the avoidance of doubt, the estimated annual value of lot 2 will be between GBP 200 000 and GBP 300 000.

            <INFO_ADD>
               <P>Please note Hertfordshire County Council has worked closely with its districts and partners to create a joint procurement portal called supply Hertfordshire. This portal provides an e-Tendering system which is run by In-Tend. To access this procurement opportunity please visit www.supplyhertfordshire.uk and follow the on-screen guidance. Open/One Stage Procedure This is a one stage procurement process. Therefore, if you wish to be considered as a tenderer you must complete and submit a tender by the specified closing date and time. Tender submissions cannot be uploaded after this return deadline. Any clarifications regarding this opportunity must be raised through Correspondence area in the eTendering system. If you are experiencing problems In-Tend offer a help section which includes a dedicated UK support desk which can be contacted via email: support@in-tend.com or Telephone: +44 1144070065 for any website/technical questions, Monday to Friday, 8:30 -17:30. The Council reserves the right at any time to cease the procurement process and not award a framework agreement or to award only part of the opportunity described in this notice. If the Council takes up this right, then they will not be responsible for or pay the expenses or losses, which may be incurred by any organisation or tenderer as a result. The Council undertakes to hold confidential any information provided in the proposal submitted, subject to the Council's obligations under the law including the Freedom of Information Act 2000. If the organisation considers that any of the information submitted in the proposal should not be disclosed because of its sensitivity then this should be stated with the reason for considering it sensitive. The Council will then endeavour to consult with the applicant about such sensitive information when considering any request received under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 before replying to such a request. The Council reserves the right to carry out additional financial checks on all organisations bidding for this opportunity at any time during the procurement process. This is to ensure that they continue to meet the Council's requirements and remain financially viable to fulfil the requirements under the Framework Agreement. The services advertised in this notice fall under the services listed in Annex XIV to Directive 2014/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council and the contracting authority is not obliged to follow The Public Contracts Regulations 2015 in full. The procurement process that will apply to the services is specified in the procurement documents accordingly. Existing Packages of Care It is the Council’s intention that all current care packages will remain with their current provider. However, this will be subject to the current provider being successfully awarded onto the framework agreement, either as a lead provider under lots 1-4 or as a framework provider under lot 5. This approach will ensure that there is a continuity of care where possible and that the market is not destabilised. Opportunities may arise to transfer packages of care where the current provider either hands back a package or needs to re-recruit significantly; impacting on consistency of carers. In these cases, the packages will be transferred to the relevant lead provider under Lots 1 to 4 of the framework agreement. For packages that are transferred over from other providers, Tenderers will need to be mindful of the TUPE provisions. Limit on Number of lots Awarded – Lots 1-4 Only — See tender documentation for full details.</P>

            <REVIEW_PROCEDURE>
               <P>The contracting authority will incorporate a minimum 10 calendar day (when using electronic means) standstill period at the point information on the award of the framework agreement is communicated to tenderers. This period allows unsuccessful tenderers to challenge the decision to award a framework agreement before a contract is executed/signed (as appropriate). The Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (“Regulations”) provide for aggrieved parties who have been harmed or at risk of harm by a breach of the rules to take action in the High Court (England, Wales and Northern Ireland). Any such action must be brought promptly and within the time limits as defined in the above regulations. Where a framework agreement has not been entered into the court may order the setting aside of the award decision or order the contracting authority to amend any document and may award damages. If the framework agreement has been entered into the court has the options to award damages and/or to shorten or order the framework agreement ineffective.</P>
