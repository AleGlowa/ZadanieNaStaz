Where the projects referenced have been implemented by consortia comprising 2 or more of the members now associated as a consortium for this tender procedure, their respective percentages shall be added together, in order for the application to be assessed on the basis of the consortium as a whole.</P><P>Previous experience which caused breach of contract and termination by a Contracting Authority shall not be used as reference.</P><P>With regard to criteria relating to economic and financial standing and to criteria relating to technical and professional ability, an economic operator could, where appropriate and for a particular contract, rely on the capacities of other entities, regardless of the legal nature of the links which it has with them.</P><P>If the tenderer relies on the capacities of other entities, it must, in that case, prove to the Contracting Authority that it will have at its disposal the resources necessary for performance of the contract, for example by producing a commitment (refer to the letter of undertaking template) on the part of those entities to place those resources at its disposal. Such entities, for instance the parent company of the economic operator, must respect the same rules of eligibility — notably that of nationality — and must fulfil the same relevant selection criteria as the economic operator. The Contracting Authority shall verify whether there are grounds for exclusion. The Contracting Authority shall require that the economic operator replaces an entity which does not meet a relevant selection criterion, or in respect of which there are compulsory grounds for exclusion.

In case of candidate being a public body, equivalent information should be provided.</P><P>Legal persons:</P><P>a) The annual turnover of the candidate must be of at least 3 000 000 EUR for each of the last 3 years for which accounts have been closed (2015, 2016 and 2017).</P><P>b) The average of cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and at the end of last 3 years (2015, 2016 and 2017) are positive.</P><P>Note to candidates: In the application form, please make sure to include the actual year for which the data is provided</P><P>2) Professional capacity of the candidate (based on items 4 and 5 of the application form). The reference period which will be taken into account will be the last 3 years from submission deadline.</P><P>Legal persons:</P><P>a) The number of the permanent staff of the candidate (individual company or consortium overall) currently working in the water and wastewater sector, must be at least 20 for each of the last 3 years (2015, 2016, 2017).</P><P>b) For each of the last 3 years (2015, 2016 and 2017), at least 50 % of the overall number of staff of the candidate (individual company or consortium overall) is permanent.</P><P>Note to candidates: In the application form, please make sure to include the actual year for which the data is provided.</P><P>3) Technical capacity of the candidate (based on items 5 and 6 of the application form). The reference period which will be taken into account will be the last five years from submission deadline.</P><P>Legal persons:</P><P>a) The candidate (individual company or consortium altogether) has implemented, during the last 5 years (April 2013 up to the deadline for the receipt of applications indicated under item 23 below), at least 2 projects of a minimum value of 1 000 000 EUR equivalent each, in delivery of water or wastewater services for urban areas of minimum 150 000 population served, including the following functions: day to day operation and maintenance, asset management, data management, operation of SCADA, financial management, billing, customer service, PR, business planning, design and implementation of nonrevenue programmes and the delivery of capital improvement projects. The candidate should demonstrate that it had a participation of minimum 50 % in each of the project(s) brought as reference</P><P>b) The candidate (individual company or consortium altogether) has implemented, during the last 5 years (April 2013 up to the deadline for the receipt of applications indicated under item 23 below) at least 2 projects of a minimum value of 300 000 EUR equivalent, for training and capacity building on above topics in 3(a), provided to a water and/or wastewater utility.

The candidate should demonstrate that it had a participation of minimum 50 % in each of the project(s) brought as reference.</P><P>Note to candidates: the projects referenced must have been completed within the reference period (although started earlier). The tenderer may refer to a part of a project/service contract which is not yet completed, but only in so far as that part is successfully completed and its date of completion, its value, and tenderer’s % contribution may be clearly identified and proven through adequate documentary evidence (such as certificates from the beneficiary). Where the projects referenced have been implemented by consortia comprising 2 or more of the members now associated as a consortium for this tender procedure, their respective percentages shall be added together, in order for the application to be assessed on the basis of the consortium as a whole.</P><P>Previous experience which caused breach of contract and termination by a Contracting Authority shall not be used as reference.</P><P>With regard to criteria relating to economic and financial standing and to criteria relating to technical and professional ability, an economic operator could, where appropriate and for a particular contract, rely on the capacities of other entities, regardless of the legal nature of the links which it has with them.</P><P>If the tenderer relies on the capacities of other entities, it must, in that case, prove to the Contracting Authority that it will have at its disposal the resources necessary for performance of the contract, for example by producing a commitment (refer to the letter of undertaking template) on the part of those entities to place those resources at its disposal. Such entities, for instance the parent company of the economic operator, must respect the same rules of eligibility — notably that of nationality — and must fulfil the same relevant selection criteria as the economic operator. The Contracting Authority shall verify whether there are grounds for exclusion. The Contracting Authority shall require that the economic operator replaces an entity which does not meet a relevant selection criterion, or in respect of which there are compulsory grounds for exclusion. The Contracting Authority may require that the economic operator substitutes an entity in respect of which there are non-compulsory grounds for exclusion. With regard to educational and professional criteria, an economic operator may only rely on the capacities of other entities where the latter will perform the services for which these capacities are required. With regard to economic and financial criteria, the entities upon whose capacity the tenderer relies become jointly liable for the execution of the contract.</P><P>If more than 8 eligible candidates meet the above selection criteria, the relative strengths and weaknesses of the applications of these candidates must be re-examined to identify the eight best candidates. The only factors which will be taken into consideration during this re-examination are:</P><P>1) The number of projects brought as references which comply with the requirements of criterion 3(a),</P><P>2) The cumulated value of projects brought as reference which comply with the requirements of criterion 3(a) above, and</P><P>3) The number of projects brought as references implemented in developing countries, which comply with the requirements of the criteria above.</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="002"><NO_MARK>22.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Award criteria</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>Best price-quality ratio.</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR></MARK_LIST></BLK_BTX_SEQ></GR_SEQ><GR_SEQ><TI_GRSEQ><BLK_BTX>APPLICATION</BLK_BTX></TI_GRSEQ><BLK_BTX_SEQ><MARK_LIST><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="001"><NO_MARK>23.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Deadline for receipt of applications</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>The applications must be received by the Contracting Authority no later than 17:00 hrs.

Such entities, for instance the parent company of the economic operator, must respect the same rules of eligibility — notably that of nationality — and must fulfil the same relevant selection criteria as the economic operator. The Contracting Authority shall verify whether there are grounds for exclusion. The Contracting Authority shall require that the economic operator replaces an entity which does not meet a relevant selection criterion, or in respect of which there are compulsory grounds for exclusion.

In case of candidate being a public body, equivalent information should be provided.</P><P>Legal persons:</P><P>a) The annual turnover of the candidate must be of at least 3 000 000 EUR for each of the last 3 years for which accounts have been closed (2015, 2016 and 2017).</P><P>b) The average of cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and at the end of last 3 years (2015, 2016 and 2017) are positive.</P><P>Note to candidates: In the application form, please make sure to include the actual year for which the data is provided</P><P>2) Professional capacity of the candidate (based on items 4 and 5 of the application form). The reference period which will be taken into account will be the last 3 years from submission deadline.</P><P>Legal persons:</P><P>a) The number of the permanent staff of the candidate (individual company or consortium overall) currently working in the water and wastewater sector, must be at least 20 for each of the last 3 years (2015, 2016, 2017).</P><P>b) For each of the last 3 years (2015, 2016 and 2017), at least 50 % of the overall number of staff of the candidate (individual company or consortium overall) is permanent.</P><P>Note to candidates: In the application form, please make sure to include the actual year for which the data is provided.</P><P>3) Technical capacity of the candidate (based on items 5 and 6 of the application form). The reference period which will be taken into account will be the last five years from submission deadline.</P><P>Legal persons:</P><P>a) The candidate (individual company or consortium altogether) has implemented, during the last 5 years (April 2013 up to the deadline for the receipt of applications indicated under item 23 below), at least 2 projects of a minimum value of 1 000 000 EUR equivalent each, in delivery of water or wastewater services for urban areas of minimum 150 000 population served, including the following functions: day to day operation and maintenance, asset management, data management, operation of SCADA, financial management, billing, customer service, PR, business planning, design and implementation of nonrevenue programmes and the delivery of capital improvement projects. The candidate should demonstrate that it had a participation of minimum 50 % in each of the project(s) brought as reference</P><P>b) The candidate (individual company or consortium altogether) has implemented, during the last 5 years (April 2013 up to the deadline for the receipt of applications indicated under item 23 below) at least 2 projects of a minimum value of 300 000 EUR equivalent, for training and capacity building on above topics in 3(a), provided to a water and/or wastewater utility.

The candidate should demonstrate that it had a participation of minimum 50 % in each of the project(s) brought as reference.</P><P>Note to candidates: the projects referenced must have been completed within the reference period (although started earlier). The tenderer may refer to a part of a project/service contract which is not yet completed, but only in so far as that part is successfully completed and its date of completion, its value, and tenderer’s % contribution may be clearly identified and proven through adequate documentary evidence (such as certificates from the beneficiary). Where the projects referenced have been implemented by consortia comprising 2 or more of the members now associated as a consortium for this tender procedure, their respective percentages shall be added together, in order for the application to be assessed on the basis of the consortium as a whole.</P><P>Previous experience which caused breach of contract and termination by a Contracting Authority shall not be used as reference.</P><P>With regard to criteria relating to economic and financial standing and to criteria relating to technical and professional ability, an economic operator could, where appropriate and for a particular contract, rely on the capacities of other entities, regardless of the legal nature of the links which it has with them.</P><P>If the tenderer relies on the capacities of other entities, it must, in that case, prove to the Contracting Authority that it will have at its disposal the resources necessary for performance of the contract, for example by producing a commitment (refer to the letter of undertaking template) on the part of those entities to place those resources at its disposal. Such entities, for instance the parent company of the economic operator, must respect the same rules of eligibility — notably that of nationality — and must fulfil the same relevant selection criteria as the economic operator. The Contracting Authority shall verify whether there are grounds for exclusion. The Contracting Authority shall require that the economic operator replaces an entity which does not meet a relevant selection criterion, or in respect of which there are compulsory grounds for exclusion. The Contracting Authority may require that the economic operator substitutes an entity in respect of which there are non-compulsory grounds for exclusion. With regard to educational and professional criteria, an economic operator may only rely on the capacities of other entities where the latter will perform the services for which these capacities are required. With regard to economic and financial criteria, the entities upon whose capacity the tenderer relies become jointly liable for the execution of the contract.</P><P>If more than 8 eligible candidates meet the above selection criteria, the relative strengths and weaknesses of the applications of these candidates must be re-examined to identify the eight best candidates. The only factors which will be taken into consideration during this re-examination are:</P><P>1) The number of projects brought as references which comply with the requirements of criterion 3(a),</P><P>2) The cumulated value of projects brought as reference which comply with the requirements of criterion 3(a) above, and</P><P>3) The number of projects brought as references implemented in developing countries, which comply with the requirements of the criteria above.</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="002"><NO_MARK>22.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Award criteria</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>Best price-quality ratio.</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR></MARK_LIST></BLK_BTX_SEQ></GR_SEQ><GR_SEQ><TI_GRSEQ><BLK_BTX>APPLICATION</BLK_BTX></TI_GRSEQ><BLK_BTX_SEQ><MARK_LIST><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="001"><NO_MARK>23.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Deadline for receipt of applications</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>The applications must be received by the Contracting Authority no later than 17:00 hrs.

Such entities, for instance the parent company of the economic operator, must respect the same rules of eligibility — notably that of nationality — and must fulfil the same relevant selection criteria as the economic operator. The Contracting Authority shall verify whether there are grounds for exclusion. The Contracting Authority shall require that the economic operator replaces an entity which does not meet a relevant selection criterion, or in respect of which there are compulsory grounds for exclusion.

In case of candidate being a public body, equivalent information should be provided.</P><P>Legal persons:</P><P>a) The annual turnover of the candidate must be of at least 3 000 000 EUR for each of the last 3 years for which accounts have been closed (2015, 2016 and 2017).</P><P>b) The average of cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and at the end of last 3 years (2015, 2016 and 2017) are positive.</P><P>Note to candidates: In the application form, please make sure to include the actual year for which the data is provided</P><P>2) Professional capacity of the candidate (based on items 4 and 5 of the application form). The reference period which will be taken into account will be the last 3 years from submission deadline.</P><P>Legal persons:</P><P>a) The number of the permanent staff of the candidate (individual company or consortium overall) currently working in the water and wastewater sector, must be at least 20 for each of the last 3 years (2015, 2016, 2017).</P><P>b) For each of the last 3 years (2015, 2016 and 2017), at least 50 % of the overall number of staff of the candidate (individual company or consortium overall) is permanent.</P><P>Note to candidates: In the application form, please make sure to include the actual year for which the data is provided.</P><P>3) Technical capacity of the candidate (based on items 5 and 6 of the application form). The reference period which will be taken into account will be the last five years from submission deadline.</P><P>Legal persons:</P><P>a) The candidate (individual company or consortium altogether) has implemented, during the last 5 years (April 2013 up to the deadline for the receipt of applications indicated under item 23 below), at least 2 projects of a minimum value of 1 000 000 EUR equivalent each, in delivery of water or wastewater services for urban areas of minimum 150 000 population served, including the following functions: day to day operation and maintenance, asset management, data management, operation of SCADA, financial management, billing, customer service, PR, business planning, design and implementation of nonrevenue programmes and the delivery of capital improvement projects. The candidate should demonstrate that it had a participation of minimum 50 % in each of the project(s) brought as reference</P><P>b) The candidate (individual company or consortium altogether) has implemented, during the last 5 years (April 2013 up to the deadline for the receipt of applications indicated under item 23 below) at least 2 projects of a minimum value of 300 000 EUR equivalent, for training and capacity building on above topics in 3(a), provided to a water and/or wastewater utility.

The candidate should demonstrate that it had a participation of minimum 50 % in each of the project(s) brought as reference.</P><P>Note to candidates: the projects referenced must have been completed within the reference period (although started earlier). The tenderer may refer to a part of a project/service contract which is not yet completed, but only in so far as that part is successfully completed and its date of completion, its value, and tenderer’s % contribution may be clearly identified and proven through adequate documentary evidence (such as certificates from the beneficiary). Where the projects referenced have been implemented by consortia comprising 2 or more of the members now associated as a consortium for this tender procedure, their respective percentages shall be added together, in order for the application to be assessed on the basis of the consortium as a whole.</P><P>Previous experience which caused breach of contract and termination by a Contracting Authority shall not be used as reference.</P><P>With regard to criteria relating to economic and financial standing and to criteria relating to technical and professional ability, an economic operator could, where appropriate and for a particular contract, rely on the capacities of other entities, regardless of the legal nature of the links which it has with them.</P><P>If the tenderer relies on the capacities of other entities, it must, in that case, prove to the Contracting Authority that it will have at its disposal the resources necessary for performance of the contract, for example by producing a commitment (refer to the letter of undertaking template) on the part of those entities to place those resources at its disposal. Such entities, for instance the parent company of the economic operator, must respect the same rules of eligibility — notably that of nationality — and must fulfil the same relevant selection criteria as the economic operator. The Contracting Authority shall verify whether there are grounds for exclusion. The Contracting Authority shall require that the economic operator replaces an entity which does not meet a relevant selection criterion, or in respect of which there are compulsory grounds for exclusion. The Contracting Authority may require that the economic operator substitutes an entity in respect of which there are non-compulsory grounds for exclusion. With regard to educational and professional criteria, an economic operator may only rely on the capacities of other entities where the latter will perform the services for which these capacities are required. With regard to economic and financial criteria, the entities upon whose capacity the tenderer relies become jointly liable for the execution of the contract.</P><P>If more than 8 eligible candidates meet the above selection criteria, the relative strengths and weaknesses of the applications of these candidates must be re-examined to identify the eight best candidates. The only factors which will be taken into consideration during this re-examination are:</P><P>1) The number of projects brought as references which comply with the requirements of criterion 3(a),</P><P>2) The cumulated value of projects brought as reference which comply with the requirements of criterion 3(a) above, and</P><P>3) The number of projects brought as references implemented in developing countries, which comply with the requirements of the criteria above.</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="002"><NO_MARK>22.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Award criteria</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>Best price-quality ratio.</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR></MARK_LIST></BLK_BTX_SEQ></GR_SEQ><GR_SEQ><TI_GRSEQ><BLK_BTX>APPLICATION</BLK_BTX></TI_GRSEQ><BLK_BTX_SEQ><MARK_LIST><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="001"><NO_MARK>23.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Deadline for receipt of applications</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>The applications must be received by the Contracting Authority no later than 17:00 hrs.

Such entities, for instance the parent company of the economic operator, must respect the same rules of eligibility — notably that of nationality — and must fulfil the same relevant selection criteria as the economic operator. The Contracting Authority shall verify whether there are grounds for exclusion. The Contracting Authority shall require that the economic operator replaces an entity which does not meet a relevant selection criterion, or in respect of which there are compulsory grounds for exclusion.

In case of candidate being a public body, equivalent information should be provided.</P><P>Legal persons:</P><P>a) The annual turnover of the candidate must be of at least 3 000 000 EUR for each of the last 3 years for which accounts have been closed (2015, 2016 and 2017).</P><P>b) The average of cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and at the end of last 3 years (2015, 2016 and 2017) are positive.</P><P>Note to candidates: In the application form, please make sure to include the actual year for which the data is provided</P><P>2) Professional capacity of the candidate (based on items 4 and 5 of the application form). The reference period which will be taken into account will be the last 3 years from submission deadline.</P><P>Legal persons:</P><P>a) The number of the permanent staff of the candidate (individual company or consortium overall) currently working in the water and wastewater sector, must be at least 20 for each of the last 3 years (2015, 2016, 2017).</P><P>b) For each of the last 3 years (2015, 2016 and 2017), at least 50 % of the overall number of staff of the candidate (individual company or consortium overall) is permanent.</P><P>Note to candidates: In the application form, please make sure to include the actual year for which the data is provided.</P><P>3) Technical capacity of the candidate (based on items 5 and 6 of the application form). The reference period which will be taken into account will be the last five years from submission deadline.</P><P>Legal persons:</P><P>a) The candidate (individual company or consortium altogether) has implemented, during the last 5 years (April 2013 up to the deadline for the receipt of applications indicated under item 23 below), at least 2 projects of a minimum value of 1 000 000 EUR equivalent each, in delivery of water or wastewater services for urban areas of minimum 150 000 population served, including the following functions: day to day operation and maintenance, asset management, data management, operation of SCADA, financial management, billing, customer service, PR, business planning, design and implementation of nonrevenue programmes and the delivery of capital improvement projects. The candidate should demonstrate that it had a participation of minimum 50 % in each of the project(s) brought as reference</P><P>b) The candidate (individual company or consortium altogether) has implemented, during the last 5 years (April 2013 up to the deadline for the receipt of applications indicated under item 23 below) at least 2 projects of a minimum value of 300 000 EUR equivalent, for training and capacity building on above topics in 3(a), provided to a water and/or wastewater utility.

The candidate should demonstrate that it had a participation of minimum 50 % in each of the project(s) brought as reference.</P><P>Note to candidates: the projects referenced must have been completed within the reference period (although started earlier). The tenderer may refer to a part of a project/service contract which is not yet completed, but only in so far as that part is successfully completed and its date of completion, its value, and tenderer’s % contribution may be clearly identified and proven through adequate documentary evidence (such as certificates from the beneficiary). Where the projects referenced have been implemented by consortia comprising 2 or more of the members now associated as a consortium for this tender procedure, their respective percentages shall be added together, in order for the application to be assessed on the basis of the consortium as a whole.</P><P>Previous experience which caused breach of contract and termination by a Contracting Authority shall not be used as reference.</P><P>With regard to criteria relating to economic and financial standing and to criteria relating to technical and professional ability, an economic operator could, where appropriate and for a particular contract, rely on the capacities of other entities, regardless of the legal nature of the links which it has with them.</P><P>If the tenderer relies on the capacities of other entities, it must, in that case, prove to the Contracting Authority that it will have at its disposal the resources necessary for performance of the contract, for example by producing a commitment (refer to the letter of undertaking template) on the part of those entities to place those resources at its disposal. Such entities, for instance the parent company of the economic operator, must respect the same rules of eligibility — notably that of nationality — and must fulfil the same relevant selection criteria as the economic operator. The Contracting Authority shall verify whether there are grounds for exclusion. The Contracting Authority shall require that the economic operator replaces an entity which does not meet a relevant selection criterion, or in respect of which there are compulsory grounds for exclusion. The Contracting Authority may require that the economic operator substitutes an entity in respect of which there are non-compulsory grounds for exclusion. With regard to educational and professional criteria, an economic operator may only rely on the capacities of other entities where the latter will perform the services for which these capacities are required. With regard to economic and financial criteria, the entities upon whose capacity the tenderer relies become jointly liable for the execution of the contract.</P><P>If more than 8 eligible candidates meet the above selection criteria, the relative strengths and weaknesses of the applications of these candidates must be re-examined to identify the eight best candidates. The only factors which will be taken into consideration during this re-examination are:</P><P>1) The number of projects brought as references which comply with the requirements of criterion 3(a),</P><P>2) The cumulated value of projects brought as reference which comply with the requirements of criterion 3(a) above, and</P><P>3) The number of projects brought as references implemented in developing countries, which comply with the requirements of the criteria above.</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="002"><NO_MARK>22.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Award criteria</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>Best price-quality ratio.</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR></MARK_LIST></BLK_BTX_SEQ></GR_SEQ><GR_SEQ><TI_GRSEQ><BLK_BTX>APPLICATION</BLK_BTX></TI_GRSEQ><BLK_BTX_SEQ><MARK_LIST><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="001"><NO_MARK>23.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Deadline for receipt of applications</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>The applications must be received by the Contracting Authority no later than 17:00 hrs.

Such entities, for instance the parent company of the economic operator, must respect the same rules of eligibility — notably that of nationality — and must fulfil the same relevant selection criteria as the economic operator. The Contracting Authority shall verify whether there are grounds for exclusion. The Contracting Authority shall require that the economic operator replaces an entity which does not meet a relevant selection criterion, or in respect of which there are compulsory grounds for exclusion.

In case of candidate being a public body, equivalent information should be provided.</P><P>Legal persons:</P><P>a) The annual turnover of the candidate must be of at least 3 000 000 EUR for each of the last 3 years for which accounts have been closed (2015, 2016 and 2017).</P><P>b) The average of cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and at the end of last 3 years (2015, 2016 and 2017) are positive.</P><P>Note to candidates: In the application form, please make sure to include the actual year for which the data is provided</P><P>2) Professional capacity of the candidate (based on items 4 and 5 of the application form). The reference period which will be taken into account will be the last 3 years from submission deadline.</P><P>Legal persons:</P><P>a) The number of the permanent staff of the candidate (individual company or consortium overall) currently working in the water and wastewater sector, must be at least 20 for each of the last 3 years (2015, 2016, 2017).</P><P>b) For each of the last 3 years (2015, 2016 and 2017), at least 50 % of the overall number of staff of the candidate (individual company or consortium overall) is permanent.</P><P>Note to candidates: In the application form, please make sure to include the actual year for which the data is provided.</P><P>3) Technical capacity of the candidate (based on items 5 and 6 of the application form). The reference period which will be taken into account will be the last five years from submission deadline.</P><P>Legal persons:</P><P>a) The candidate (individual company or consortium altogether) has implemented, during the last 5 years (April 2013 up to the deadline for the receipt of applications indicated under item 23 below), at least 2 projects of a minimum value of 1 000 000 EUR equivalent each, in delivery of water or wastewater services for urban areas of minimum 150 000 population served, including the following functions: day to day operation and maintenance, asset management, data management, operation of SCADA, financial management, billing, customer service, PR, business planning, design and implementation of nonrevenue programmes and the delivery of capital improvement projects. The candidate should demonstrate that it had a participation of minimum 50 % in each of the project(s) brought as reference</P><P>b) The candidate (individual company or consortium altogether) has implemented, during the last 5 years (April 2013 up to the deadline for the receipt of applications indicated under item 23 below) at least 2 projects of a minimum value of 300 000 EUR equivalent, for training and capacity building on above topics in 3(a), provided to a water and/or wastewater utility.

The candidate should demonstrate that it had a participation of minimum 50 % in each of the project(s) brought as reference.</P><P>Note to candidates: the projects referenced must have been completed within the reference period (although started earlier). The tenderer may refer to a part of a project/service contract which is not yet completed, but only in so far as that part is successfully completed and its date of completion, its value, and tenderer’s % contribution may be clearly identified and proven through adequate documentary evidence (such as certificates from the beneficiary). Where the projects referenced have been implemented by consortia comprising 2 or more of the members now associated as a consortium for this tender procedure, their respective percentages shall be added together, in order for the application to be assessed on the basis of the consortium as a whole.</P><P>Previous experience which caused breach of contract and termination by a Contracting Authority shall not be used as reference.</P><P>With regard to criteria relating to economic and financial standing and to criteria relating to technical and professional ability, an economic operator could, where appropriate and for a particular contract, rely on the capacities of other entities, regardless of the legal nature of the links which it has with them.</P><P>If the tenderer relies on the capacities of other entities, it must, in that case, prove to the Contracting Authority that it will have at its disposal the resources necessary for performance of the contract, for example by producing a commitment (refer to the letter of undertaking template) on the part of those entities to place those resources at its disposal. Such entities, for instance the parent company of the economic operator, must respect the same rules of eligibility — notably that of nationality — and must fulfil the same relevant selection criteria as the economic operator. The Contracting Authority shall verify whether there are grounds for exclusion. The Contracting Authority shall require that the economic operator replaces an entity which does not meet a relevant selection criterion, or in respect of which there are compulsory grounds for exclusion. The Contracting Authority may require that the economic operator substitutes an entity in respect of which there are non-compulsory grounds for exclusion. With regard to educational and professional criteria, an economic operator may only rely on the capacities of other entities where the latter will perform the services for which these capacities are required. With regard to economic and financial criteria, the entities upon whose capacity the tenderer relies become jointly liable for the execution of the contract.</P><P>If more than 8 eligible candidates meet the above selection criteria, the relative strengths and weaknesses of the applications of these candidates must be re-examined to identify the eight best candidates. The only factors which will be taken into consideration during this re-examination are:</P><P>1) The number of projects brought as references which comply with the requirements of criterion 3(a),</P><P>2) The cumulated value of projects brought as reference which comply with the requirements of criterion 3(a) above, and</P><P>3) The number of projects brought as references implemented in developing countries, which comply with the requirements of the criteria above.</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="002"><NO_MARK>22.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Award criteria</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>Best price-quality ratio.</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR></MARK_LIST></BLK_BTX_SEQ></GR_SEQ><GR_SEQ><TI_GRSEQ><BLK_BTX>APPLICATION</BLK_BTX></TI_GRSEQ><BLK_BTX_SEQ><MARK_LIST><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="001"><NO_MARK>23.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Deadline for receipt of applications</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>The applications must be received by the Contracting Authority no later than 17:00 hrs.

Such entities, for instance the parent company of the economic operator, must respect the same rules of eligibility — notably that of nationality — and must fulfil the same relevant selection criteria as the economic operator. The Contracting Authority shall verify whether there are grounds for exclusion. The Contracting Authority shall require that the economic operator replaces an entity which does not meet a relevant selection criterion, or in respect of which there are compulsory grounds for exclusion.

In case of candidate being a public body, equivalent information should be provided.</P><P>Legal persons:</P><P>a) The annual turnover of the candidate must be of at least 3 000 000 EUR for each of the last 3 years for which accounts have been closed (2015, 2016 and 2017).</P><P>b) The average of cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and at the end of last 3 years (2015, 2016 and 2017) are positive.</P><P>Note to candidates: In the application form, please make sure to include the actual year for which the data is provided</P><P>2) Professional capacity of the candidate (based on items 4 and 5 of the application form). The reference period which will be taken into account will be the last 3 years from submission deadline.</P><P>Legal persons:</P><P>a) The number of the permanent staff of the candidate (individual company or consortium overall) currently working in the water and wastewater sector, must be at least 20 for each of the last 3 years (2015, 2016, 2017).</P><P>b) For each of the last 3 years (2015, 2016 and 2017), at least 50 % of the overall number of staff of the candidate (individual company or consortium overall) is permanent.</P><P>Note to candidates: In the application form, please make sure to include the actual year for which the data is provided.</P><P>3) Technical capacity of the candidate (based on items 5 and 6 of the application form). The reference period which will be taken into account will be the last five years from submission deadline.</P><P>Legal persons:</P><P>a) The candidate (individual company or consortium altogether) has implemented, during the last 5 years (April 2013 up to the deadline for the receipt of applications indicated under item 23 below), at least 2 projects of a minimum value of 1 000 000 EUR equivalent each, in delivery of water or wastewater services for urban areas of minimum 150 000 population served, including the following functions: day to day operation and maintenance, asset management, data management, operation of SCADA, financial management, billing, customer service, PR, business planning, design and implementation of nonrevenue programmes and the delivery of capital improvement projects. The candidate should demonstrate that it had a participation of minimum 50 % in each of the project(s) brought as reference</P><P>b) The candidate (individual company or consortium altogether) has implemented, during the last 5 years (April 2013 up to the deadline for the receipt of applications indicated under item 23 below) at least 2 projects of a minimum value of 300 000 EUR equivalent, for training and capacity building on above topics in 3(a), provided to a water and/or wastewater utility.

The candidate should demonstrate that it had a participation of minimum 50 % in each of the project(s) brought as reference.</P><P>Note to candidates: the projects referenced must have been completed within the reference period (although started earlier). The tenderer may refer to a part of a project/service contract which is not yet completed, but only in so far as that part is successfully completed and its date of completion, its value, and tenderer’s % contribution may be clearly identified and proven through adequate documentary evidence (such as certificates from the beneficiary). Where the projects referenced have been implemented by consortia comprising 2 or more of the members now associated as a consortium for this tender procedure, their respective percentages shall be added together, in order for the application to be assessed on the basis of the consortium as a whole.</P><P>Previous experience which caused breach of contract and termination by a Contracting Authority shall not be used as reference.</P><P>With regard to criteria relating to economic and financial standing and to criteria relating to technical and professional ability, an economic operator could, where appropriate and for a particular contract, rely on the capacities of other entities, regardless of the legal nature of the links which it has with them.</P><P>If the tenderer relies on the capacities of other entities, it must, in that case, prove to the Contracting Authority that it will have at its disposal the resources necessary for performance of the contract, for example by producing a commitment (refer to the letter of undertaking template) on the part of those entities to place those resources at its disposal. Such entities, for instance the parent company of the economic operator, must respect the same rules of eligibility — notably that of nationality — and must fulfil the same relevant selection criteria as the economic operator. The Contracting Authority shall verify whether there are grounds for exclusion. The Contracting Authority shall require that the economic operator replaces an entity which does not meet a relevant selection criterion, or in respect of which there are compulsory grounds for exclusion. The Contracting Authority may require that the economic operator substitutes an entity in respect of which there are non-compulsory grounds for exclusion. With regard to educational and professional criteria, an economic operator may only rely on the capacities of other entities where the latter will perform the services for which these capacities are required. With regard to economic and financial criteria, the entities upon whose capacity the tenderer relies become jointly liable for the execution of the contract.</P><P>If more than 8 eligible candidates meet the above selection criteria, the relative strengths and weaknesses of the applications of these candidates must be re-examined to identify the eight best candidates. The only factors which will be taken into consideration during this re-examination are:</P><P>1) The number of projects brought as references which comply with the requirements of criterion 3(a),</P><P>2) The cumulated value of projects brought as reference which comply with the requirements of criterion 3(a) above, and</P><P>3) The number of projects brought as references implemented in developing countries, which comply with the requirements of the criteria above.</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="002"><NO_MARK>22.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Award criteria</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>Best price-quality ratio.</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR></MARK_LIST></BLK_BTX_SEQ></GR_SEQ><GR_SEQ><TI_GRSEQ><BLK_BTX>APPLICATION</BLK_BTX></TI_GRSEQ><BLK_BTX_SEQ><MARK_LIST><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="001"><NO_MARK>23.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Deadline for receipt of applications</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>The applications must be received by the Contracting Authority no later than 17:00 hrs.

In case of candidate being a public body, equivalent information should be provided.</P><P>Legal persons:</P><P>a) The annual turnover of the candidate must be of at least 3 000 000 EUR for each of the last 3 years for which accounts have been closed (2015, 2016 and 2017).</P><P>b) The average of cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and at the end of last 3 years (2015, 2016 and 2017) are positive.</P><P>Note to candidates: In the application form, please make sure to include the actual year for which the data is provided</P><P>2) Professional capacity of the candidate (based on items 4 and 5 of the application form). The reference period which will be taken into account will be the last 3 years from submission deadline.</P><P>Legal persons:</P><P>a) The number of the permanent staff of the candidate (individual company or consortium overall) currently working in the water and wastewater sector, must be at least 20 for each of the last 3 years (2015, 2016, 2017).</P><P>b) For each of the last 3 years (2015, 2016 and 2017), at least 50 % of the overall number of staff of the candidate (individual company or consortium overall) is permanent.</P><P>Note to candidates: In the application form, please make sure to include the actual year for which the data is provided.</P><P>3) Technical capacity of the candidate (based on items 5 and 6 of the application form). The reference period which will be taken into account will be the last five years from submission deadline.</P><P>Legal persons:</P><P>a) The candidate (individual company or consortium altogether) has implemented, during the last 5 years (April 2013 up to the deadline for the receipt of applications indicated under item 23 below), at least 2 projects of a minimum value of 1 000 000 EUR equivalent each, in delivery of water or wastewater services for urban areas of minimum 150 000 population served, including the following functions: day to day operation and maintenance, asset management, data management, operation of SCADA, financial management, billing, customer service, PR, business planning, design and implementation of nonrevenue programmes and the delivery of capital improvement projects. The candidate should demonstrate that it had a participation of minimum 50 % in each of the project(s) brought as reference</P><P>b) The candidate (individual company or consortium altogether) has implemented, during the last 5 years (April 2013 up to the deadline for the receipt of applications indicated under item 23 below) at least 2 projects of a minimum value of 300 000 EUR equivalent, for training and capacity building on above topics in 3(a), provided to a water and/or wastewater utility.

The candidate should demonstrate that it had a participation of minimum 50 % in each of the project(s) brought as reference.</P><P>Note to candidates: the projects referenced must have been completed within the reference period (although started earlier). The tenderer may refer to a part of a project/service contract which is not yet completed, but only in so far as that part is successfully completed and its date of completion, its value, and tenderer’s % contribution may be clearly identified and proven through adequate documentary evidence (such as certificates from the beneficiary). Where the projects referenced have been implemented by consortia comprising 2 or more of the members now associated as a consortium for this tender procedure, their respective percentages shall be added together, in order for the application to be assessed on the basis of the consortium as a whole.</P><P>Previous experience which caused breach of contract and termination by a Contracting Authority shall not be used as reference.</P><P>With regard to criteria relating to economic and financial standing and to criteria relating to technical and professional ability, an economic operator could, where appropriate and for a particular contract, rely on the capacities of other entities, regardless of the legal nature of the links which it has with them.</P><P>If the tenderer relies on the capacities of other entities, it must, in that case, prove to the Contracting Authority that it will have at its disposal the resources necessary for performance of the contract, for example by producing a commitment (refer to the letter of undertaking template) on the part of those entities to place those resources at its disposal. Such entities, for instance the parent company of the economic operator, must respect the same rules of eligibility — notably that of nationality — and must fulfil the same relevant selection criteria as the economic operator. The Contracting Authority shall verify whether there are grounds for exclusion. The Contracting Authority shall require that the economic operator replaces an entity which does not meet a relevant selection criterion, or in respect of which there are compulsory grounds for exclusion. The Contracting Authority may require that the economic operator substitutes an entity in respect of which there are non-compulsory grounds for exclusion. With regard to educational and professional criteria, an economic operator may only rely on the capacities of other entities where the latter will perform the services for which these capacities are required. With regard to economic and financial criteria, the entities upon whose capacity the tenderer relies become jointly liable for the execution of the contract.</P><P>If more than 8 eligible candidates meet the above selection criteria, the relative strengths and weaknesses of the applications of these candidates must be re-examined to identify the eight best candidates. The only factors which will be taken into consideration during this re-examination are:</P><P>1) The number of projects brought as references which comply with the requirements of criterion 3(a),</P><P>2) The cumulated value of projects brought as reference which comply with the requirements of criterion 3(a) above, and</P><P>3) The number of projects brought as references implemented in developing countries, which comply with the requirements of the criteria above.</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="002"><NO_MARK>22.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Award criteria</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>Best price-quality ratio.</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR></MARK_LIST></BLK_BTX_SEQ></GR_SEQ><GR_SEQ><TI_GRSEQ><BLK_BTX>APPLICATION</BLK_BTX></TI_GRSEQ><BLK_BTX_SEQ><MARK_LIST><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="001"><NO_MARK>23.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Deadline for receipt of applications</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>The applications must be received by the Contracting Authority no later than 17:00 hrs.
