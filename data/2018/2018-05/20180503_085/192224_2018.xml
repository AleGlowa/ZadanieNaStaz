               <P>At this time, NHS England would like to determine the potential level of provider interest in L and D services across the South, from all sectors in preparation for hosting an engagement event in Reading. The provisional date is 4.6.2018. It will be an opportunity for providers to gain further understanding of the Commissioner’s intentions and provide feedback to inform the final specification and procurement strategy. Further details of the event including venue details and confirmed date will be provided to those who express an interest.</P>

                  <P>Liaison and Diversion Services in Devon and Cornwall.</P>
                  <P>NHS England South is seeking to commission L and D Services across the South.</P>
                  <P>There are high numbers of people with mental health, learning disability, substance misuse and other psychosocial vulnerabilities who enter the youth and criminal justice systems, who could be dealt with in the community, or diverted from the justice pathway altogether, as well as requiring early identification should custodial sentences be applied.</P>
                  <P>The aim of the L and D Service is to provide early intervention for vulnerable people (adults, children and young people) as they come to the attention of the criminal justice system. The service will provide a prompt response to concerns raised by the police, youth offending teams, court staff or any other referral process (including self-referral) and provide critical information to decision-makers in the justice system, in real time, when it comes to charging and sentencing. The service will also act as a point of referral and follow up for these service users, to ensure they can access, and are supported to attend community treatment and rehabilitation appointments.</P>
                  <P>The contract duration is likely to be for 3 years with an extension of 3 years, with a commencement date of April 2019.</P>
                  <P>The procurement exercise is likely to be split into multiple lots across the areas below and with values ranging from 525 000 GBP to 1 800 000 GBP.</P>

               <P>Please note that the final lotting strategy has not been finalised. Part of the provider engagement will inform commissioners of the final number and combination of lots which will be advertised at tender stage.</P>
               <P>At this time, NHS England would like to determine the potential level of provider interest from all sectors in preparation for hosting an engagement event in Reading. The provisional date is 4.6.2018. Further details of the event including venue details and confirmed date will be provided to those who express an interest.</P>
               <P>Interested providers must complete a Providing Sounding Questionnaire.</P>
               <P>If you are interested in attending, please go to In-Tend https://in-tendhost.co.uk/scwcsu/aspx/Home where you will be able to view the provider market event opportunity via the “current tenders” list on in-tend, by searching for “Liaison and Diversion – Early Provider Engagement Event” or by following the direct link: https://in-tendhost.co.uk/scwcsu/aspx/ProjectManage/733</P>
               <P>If you are not already registered on the system you will need to do so before you can fully access the opportunity and return your questionnaire.</P>
               <P>Please complete the provider market sounding questionnaire attached within In-Tend and return by 12:00 pm Tuesday 22nd May.</P>
               <P>This exercise is being carried out by NHS South, Central and West Commissioning Support Unit (SCW) on behalf of NHS England Commissioners.</P>
               <P>This notice is an information gathering exercise rather than a call for competition in its own right, and therefore publication or response does not commit NHS England or respondents to any award of contracts or to any future procurement, nor provide any process exemptions or preferential treatment to any parties expressing an interest. NHS England will not be liable for costs incurred by any interested party in participating in this exercise.</P>
