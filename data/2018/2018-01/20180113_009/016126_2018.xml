            <REVIEW_PROCEDURE>
               <P>Economic operators who are unsuccessful at the SQ stage shall be informed by the contracting authority as soon as possible after the decision is made as to the reasons why the application to join the DPS was unsuccessful. If an economic operator requires any additional information following this initial de-briefing, this should be requested from the address at Section I.1 of this Notice. If an appeal regarding the decision to award a position the DPS has not been successfully resolved, then the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (SI 2015/102) provide for aggrieved parties who have been harmed or are at risk of harm by a breach of the rules to take action in the High Court (England, Wales and Northern Ireland). Any such action must be started within 30 days beginning with the date when the aggrieved party first knew or sought to have grounds for starting the proceedings had risen. The Court may extend the time limited for starting proceedings where the Court considers that there is a good reason for doing so, but not so as to permit proceedings to be started more than 3 months after that date. Where a position on the DPS or a specific contract called off thereunder has not been entered into, the Court may order the setting aside of the award decision or order for any document to be amended and may award damages, make a declaration of ineffectiveness, order for a fine to be paid, and/or order the duration of the contract to be shortened. If however the contract has been concluded, the Court may only award damages or, where the contract award procedures have not been followed correctly, declare any decision relating to any request to participate on the DPS or any specific contract awarded under the DPS to be ineffective.</P>
