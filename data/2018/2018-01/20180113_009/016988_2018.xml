It would be uneconomic and cause significant inconvenience to the programme for the production, personalization and distribution of public service cards if a new contractor had to be procured during the interim period pending the commencement of a future contract in response to the anticipated RFT noted in section II.2.7 above. It would cost significantly less to continue the current service with the existing contractor than to tender for a different contractor for an interim period pending the award of a new contract. A change of contractor for this interim period would result in significant inconvenience due to the temporary disruption of service pending the appointment of a new contractor.</P><P>The contracting authority expects that it will take a new contractor, to be appointed pursuant to the RFT noted in section II.2.7 above, between eight and ten months to become operational. The purpose of this modification is to allow the continuation of the service for the intervening period until the new contract is operational.</P><P>Duration in month:</P><P>The modified contract will commence on the 1.1.2018 and will run until the 31.12.2018 at the latest.
