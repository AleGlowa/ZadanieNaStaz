of the contract.</P><P>Candidates should note that in accordance with Clause 5.2, services provided will be settled on the basis of time spent.</P><P>Consultants should expect to work both in DALO‘s premises in Ballerup and at their own home office, but project-related travel activity to other DALO locations in Denmark should be expected approximately 6 days per month. Working from home office necessitates a secured locker in which DALO computer can be stored when not in use. The locker shall be approved by DALO security officer.</P></FREQUENCY_AWARDED_CONTRACTS></TOTAL_ESTIMATED></F17_FRAMEWORK><SHORT_CONTRACT_DESCRIPTION><P>The Danish Defence Acquisition and Logistics Organization (DALO) is implementing the Army Tactical Communication Network (ATCN) into a range of vehicles and platforms operated by the Danish Army. This tender pertains to a framework agreement regarding engineering and technical support for implementing the ATCN in the form of gathering end-user experiences, evaluating methods of integration (including estimating the necessary cable work), coding and implementation of software, drawing cables, testing solution viability, and documenting the work performed in a format which can be used for both maintenance and training purposes.</P><P>Candidates should note that the completion of the work described above requires the successful tender to enter into a cooperation agreement with Systematic regarding the integration of Systematic software into the new ACTN solution. This cooperation agreement will be supplemented by a three-party NDA between the winning tenderer, DALO, and Systematic. Candidates should note that it will be a contractual requirement that the winning tenderer must offer an on-demand guarantee of DKK 1 million to Systematic for the coverage of potential payment of liquidated damages in case of breach of the secrecy obligations.</P><P>The guarantee will be returned to the tenderer after completion of the work involving Systematic’s Sitaware software packages under the agreement. Please see Section IV.1.2) of this Contract Notice for further information.</P><P>Candidates should further note that the project is currently ongoing within DALO, and consultants who have not previously been involved with the project are therefore expected to go through a transition period of maximum 3 months in order to attain the necessary background knowledge and project specific technical capacities.</P><P>Candidates should note that consultants will not be remunerated in the transition period, and expenses regarding diets and transportation will not be reimbursed during the transition period. The framework agreement will contain an opt-out clause in case of DALO after a transition period of three months deems that the consultants are unable to work at the required standard while unsupervised.</P><P>The work performed by the consultants entails giving advice on the best possible integration of different existing products and software within the Danish Defence into the vehicles and platforms as well as strategic advisory services regarding the future development of products, software, and the integration solution itself. Since the consultants in this capacity will be trusted advisers to the Danish Defence with respect to the design of future procurements to the communication systems, vehicles etc., no consultant may be in a position throughout the duration of this framework agreement to recommend or include products or software packages in any recommendation, in which the consultant may have vested interests.</P><P>Furthermore, DALO does not consider it feasible for DALO to identify situations in which DALO must seek advice from alternative sources in order to address a potential conflict of interest for the consultants. Therefore, in order to mitigate the risk of conflicts of interests between DALO and the winning tenderer, DALO has deemed it necessary to consider only candidates who have not delivered the products, which are currently subject to the integration work and advisory services.</P><P>The framework agreement will equally contain regulation, which restricts the successful tenderer from being in a similar conflict of interest concerning future deliveries of products and software to be integrated into the vehicles and platforms. This limitation will be applicable throughout the duration of this framework agreement.</P><P>Candidates should note that they must hold a facility security clearance at the level of NATO - Restricted (or Danish level “Til Tjenestebrug”) or higher at the time of expiry of the deadline for prequalification application, cf. clause III.1.5) of this Contract Notice. Also, key personnel must have obtained a personal level security clearance no later than the time of expiry of the deadline for tender. Please also see clause VI.3) of this Contract Notice regarding personal level security clearances.</P><P>It should be noted that the Framework agreement contains a minimum requirement pertaining to Danish language competency of the consultants, cf. Appendix A.</P></SHORT_CONTRACT_DESCRIPTION><CPV><CPV_MAIN><CPV_CODE CODE="71311000"/></CPV_MAIN><CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_CODE CODE="32412000"/></CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_CODE CODE="32415000"/></CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_CODE CODE="32418000"/></CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_CODE CODE="32420000"/></CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_CODE CODE="32520000"/></CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_CODE CODE="71220000"/></CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_CODE CODE="71300000"/></CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_CODE CODE="71316000"/></CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_CODE CODE="71320000"/></CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_CODE CODE="71600000"/></CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_CODE CODE="71621000"/></CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_CODE CODE="72000000"/></CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_CODE CODE="72227000"/></CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_CODE CODE="72228000"/></CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_CODE CODE="72230000"/></CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_CODE CODE="72231000"/></CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_CODE CODE="72246000"/></CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_CODE CODE="73430000"/></CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_CODE CODE="73433000"/></CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_CODE CODE="32421000"/></CPV_ADDITIONAL></CPV><SUBCONTRACTING><INDICATE_ANY_SHARE VALUE="NO"/><INDICATE_ANY_CHANGE VALUE="NO"/><SUBCONTRACT_AWARD_PART VALUE="NO"/><IDENTIFY_SUBCONTRACT VALUE="NO"/></SUBCONTRACTING><F17_DIVISION_INTO_LOTS><DIV_INTO_LOT_NO/></F17_DIVISION_INTO_LOTS><ACCEPTED_VARIANTS VALUE="NO"/></DESCRIPTION_CONTRACT_INFORMATION_DEFENCE><QUANTITY_SCOPE><NATURE_QUANTITY_SCOPE><TOTAL_QUANTITY_OR_SCOPE><P>The framework agreement is subject to 1 possible renewal, cf. clause II.2.3) of this Contract Notice.
