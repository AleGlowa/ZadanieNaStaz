signed with a service provider that will undertake communication activities on the projects or initiatives covered by Delegation Agreements signed by the EIB with the EC and on other initiatives and

The objective of these communications activities is to ensure that multiple audiences and stakeholders (clients, partners, general public, etc.) have all necessary information on the different initiatives and projects covered by Delegation Agreements signed by the EIB with the EC and on other initiatives and projects as necessary. The services to be implemented under the framework agreement will mostly consist of assignments lasting several years, but could also cover short-term services mobilised at short notice. The framework agreement will start at a 0 EUR value. There will be no payment on the signature of the agreement with the service provider. The estimated budget available for the framework agreement will be EUR 10 000 000. For each assignment, there will be a distinct contract between the EIB and the selected service provider. The maximum amount spendable under an assignment will be fixed at the level of each contract. No guarantee will be provided as to the number of requests for services sent to the service provider, as to the number of contracts awarded or as to the total amount contracted.</P><P>Some activities that could be included in the assignments include, but are not limited to the following:</P><P>— Development and implementation of integrated communication plans,</P><P>— Development of key messages and narratives,</P><P>— Development, design and implementation of media strategies (locally, nationally and internationally) and press and media activities,</P><P>— Development, design and implementation of digital strategies and website creation and activities,</P><P>— Development, design and implementation of social media strategies (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn) and social media activities,</P><P>— Development and design of editorial content, material and publications and publishing activities,</P><P>— Production and design (printing, manufacturing, etc.) of communication and marketing products and stationery material (banners, brochures, flyers, etc.),</P><P>— Production of audio-visual material and narratives,</P><P>— Organisation and coordination of events:</P><P>—— Marketing events with banks and possible beneficiaries,</P><P>—— Media events and journalist visits to programme projects,</P><P>—— Conferences and workshops,</P><P>— Production of traditional media and social media monitoring reports.</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="005"><NO_MARK>II.1.5)</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Estimated total value</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>Value excluding VAT: EUR 10 000 000</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="006"><NO_MARK>II.1.6)</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Information about lots</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>This contract is divided into lots: No</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR></MARK_LIST></BLK_BTX_SEQ></GR_SEQ><GR_SEQ><TI_GRSEQ><BLK_BTX>II.2) Description</BLK_BTX></TI_GRSEQ><BLK_BTX_SEQ><MARK_LIST><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="001"><NO_MARK>II.2.1)</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Title:</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>Provision of communication services on projects or initiatives financed under various facilities</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="002"><NO_MARK>II.2.2)</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Additional CPV code(s)</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>79400000</P><P>79340000</P><P>79342200</P><P>79900000</P><P>79413000</P><P>79416100</P><P>79416200</P><P>79952000</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="003"><NO_MARK>II.2.3)</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Place of performance</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>The place of delivery for each assignment will be specified in assignment Terms of Reference (ToRs).

The services to be implemented under the framework agreement will mostly consist of assignments lasting several years, but could also cover short-term services mobilised at short notice. The framework agreement will start at a 0 EUR value. There will be no payment on the signature of the agreement with the service provider. The estimated budget available for the framework agreement will be EUR 10 000 000. For each assignment, there will be a distinct contract between the EIB and the selected service provider. The maximum amount spendable under an assignment will be fixed at the level of each contract.

The framework agreement will start at a 0 EUR value. There will be no payment on the signature of the agreement with the service provider. The estimated budget available for the framework agreement will be EUR 10 000 000. For each assignment, there will be a distinct contract between the EIB and the selected service provider. The maximum amount spendable under an assignment will be fixed at the level of each contract.
