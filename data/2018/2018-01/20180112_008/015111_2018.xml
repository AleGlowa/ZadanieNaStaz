            <INFO_ADD>
               <P>The tender procedure is subject to Danish law. Any legal entity may only submit 1 application.</P>
               <P>Participation in the tendering procedure may only take place by electronic means via the electronic tendering system used by the contracting authority, see the address set out in section 1.3). The tendering procedure is accessed under the tab “Ongoing public procedures”. For access to the tender documents, the tenderer must be registered or register as a user.</P>
               <P>If a tender contains more than one version of the same document, the latest uploaded version, cf. the time-log in the system, will be regarded as the prevailing version.</P>
               <P>In the tendering system the tenderer can sign up to receive notifications by e-mail upon upload of new information. The tenderers are however always encouraged to keep themselves updated in the system on an ongoing basis. All communication in connection with the tender procedure, including questions and answers, must be through the electronic tendering system. Questions must be submitted not later than 1 February 2018. Questions asked after this date will be answered if they are received in time for the contracting authority to provide the information required and communicate the answers not later than 6 days before expiry of the date for submission of tenders. Questions received later than 6 days before expiry of the deadline cannot expect to be answered.</P>
               <P>The tenderer must submit an ESPD as preliminary documentation of the circumstances set out in section 148 (1) (i-iii) of the Danish Public Procurement Act (in Danish: Udbudsloven). For groups of operators (e.g. a consortium), a separate ESPD must be submitted for each participating operator. If the tenderer relies on the capacity of other entities, an ESPD must be submitted for each of the entities on which the tenderer relies. An ESPD guide is enclosed in the tender docs.</P>
               <P>The tenderer will be excluded from participation in the tender procedure if the tenderer is covered by the exclusion grounds listed in the Danish Public Procurement Act, section 135 and section 136 (EU Directive 2014/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, article 57(1)-(3), and article 57(4) (e),(f) and (h).) A tenderer will furthermore be excluded from the procurement procedure if the tenderer is in a situation covered by the Danish Public Procurement Act section 137 (1)(2) (EU Directive 2014/24/EU of the European Parliament and of The Council, article 57 (4) (b)).</P>
               <P>Before the decision to award the contract is made, the tenderer to whom the contracting authority intends to award the contract must provide documentation of the information submitted in the ESPD pursuant to sections 151-152, cf. section 153 of the Danish Public Procurement Act. For Danish tenderer documentation can be presented in the form of a ‘serviceattest’. Entities from other EU member states may identify the relevant certificate(s) using the online platform e-Certis. Where the country in question does not issue such documents or certificates, or where these do not cover all the cases specified, they may be replaced by a declaration on oath or, in countries where there is no provision for declarations on oath, by a solemn declaration made by the person concerned before a competent judicial or administrative authority, a notary or a competent professional or trade body, in the country of origin or in the country where the economic operator is established.</P>
               <P>The Embassy reserves the right – but is not obliged – to use the remedies provided for in the Danish Public Procurement Act, section 159, stk. 5, in the event, that tenderers or tenders do not comply with the formal requirements of the procurement documents (EU Directive 2014/24/EU, article 56 (3)). As for IV.2.2, “Local time” refers to Danish time (i.e. currently Central European Time (CET), UTC +1).</P>
