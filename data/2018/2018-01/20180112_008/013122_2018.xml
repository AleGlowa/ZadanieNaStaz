               <P>The Danish Defence utilises the great abilities of various races of dogs during a series of different tasks in the category of defence and security. This tender encompasses food for these Defence Working Dogs (DWD). The DWD will be challenged from when they are pups to their retirement and the requirements on their performance are great. Their performance and well-being is largely based on the quality and appropriateness of the food they are provided. DALO is responsible for the supply of food by a Framework Agreement encompassing various kinds of food targeted a specific diet need. The foods described in the requirements specification are specifically drafted to meet the requirements of the DWD. The purpose of the Framework Agreement is thus to secure and maintain a steady, reliable and quick delivery of various kinds of tested and tried high-quality food to support the DWD during training, work and under various other circumstances.</P>

                  <P>DALO requires reliable and timely delivery of various kinds of high-quality dog food designed for specific purposes.</P>
                  <P>The Tenderer must offer all of the required types of food.</P>
                  <P>The Tenderer must be able to accommodate short notice purchase orders of different sizes.</P>
                  <P>The Tenderer must offer instructions and support to DALO related to the offered and delivered food.</P>
                  <P>The Danish Defence utilises the great abilities of various races of dogs during a series of different tasks in the category of defence and security.</P>
                  <P>The DWD is mainly of the races German shepherd and Malinois but there are also a few other races such as Labradors and Spaniels. The dogs are used for many purposes. One of its prime duties is to patrol large military areas where the dog with its dog handler is searching many kinds of locations. During this guard duty, the dog is exposed to particularly high levels of strain to its musculoskeletal system as it runs many kilometres and does quite a lot of jumping. Some DWD is also used to search for different items such as explosives and drugs. This search is also exposing the dog to quite a lot of jumps up and down as well as to a lot of stairs that need to be scaled. This is also putting a high level of strain on the dog's musculoskeletal system.</P>
                  <P>After duty, all DWD are taken home to the dog handler's private home where it is living quite an ordinary family dog's life. As well as the dog handler the dog itself is also an employee of the Danish Defence that has a job to carry out.</P>
                  <P>At times the dog must be placed in kennels. That can be quite stressing to the dog. In the kennels, there are many other dogs and all together they can create quite a lot of noise. Large concentrations of dogs and the derived levels of noise can occur nationally as well as internationally in connection with larger tasks or during longer missions to other countries.</P>
                  <P>The Danish Defence is making a great effort to ensure that the dogs live under optimum conditions. All the different military units that have dogs in their service also have a veterinarian attached. In addition, and in order to optimize the well-being of the dogs, the units also have access to trained dog masseurs, dog chiropractors, dog physiotherapists and swimming pools and treadmills.</P>
                  <P>DWD employed by the Danish Defence have a near perfect dog life. But that life is not without costs as the dogs are exposed to great strain and large physical wear.</P>
                  <P>For that reason, the Danish Defence is interested in a diet that provides the DWD with optimum well-being and the possibility to adjust the diet to the needs of each individual dog.</P>
                  <P>The supplier shall offer DALO the following products:</P>
                  <P>— Puppy diets,</P>
