                  <P>The tender project is seeking to appoint a Supplier/s whose initiative and innovation will be welcomed for the provision of service within the existing facilities at each school, with a focus on exciting new food concepts to satisfy a wide range of pupil tastes and dietary requirements. The Schools would wish the successful Supplier/s to review the current range of services offered and make recommendations accordingly.</P>
                  <P>The contract being tendered is for 3 years in duration from 1.1.2018 to 31.12.2020 and will operate as a guaranteed performance contract, with the successful Supplier offering the School a guaranteed return / cost per annum for the provision of catering services. Sovereignty of the cash tariff is to remain with the Schools for the duration of this contract.</P>
                  <P>The school year is based on a calendar of 195 days. 5 days are to be used for staff professional development which means that School will be open to receive students for the legal minimum of 190 days.</P>
                  <P>The contract offered covers the scope for the provision of all catering services within the Schools. Free School Meals and hospitality will be charged based on consumption and at net food cost.</P>
                  <P>Whilst the Schools prioritise value for money as a key objective of the competitive tender process, the governing bodies are not obliged to accept the lowest price.</P>
                  <P>The Schools expect the successful Supplier/s to enable the continued development of catering through the provision of an innovative, healthy food service, with fresh, seasonal, locally sourced ingredients being prepared on-site. The Schools expect the successful Supplier/s to evidence, through their bid, how they shall support and complement the values and support the principles of Every Child Matters.</P>
                  <P>The Schools believe that success should be celebrated and that pupils should enjoy their time at school; if lessons are stimulating and challenging then students will love learning. Much time therefore, is spent reviewing and planning schemes of work to ensure that they are differentiated to meet the needs of all students. As a result, the Schools are very enthusiastic regarding work experience and apprenticeship proposals and would welcome the input of the successful Supplier/s.</P>
                  <P>As schools who are continually seeking ways to improve and develop the ethos and environment for students and staff, to give them the facilities they deserve and need to meet the challenges of the 21st Century, any consideration regarding inward capital investment as part of Suppliers' tender submission would be welcomed. The Schools would wish for Suppliers to look at making this investment within the existing dining area.</P>
                  <P>Please be advised that the contract/s will be let for 3 + 2 years.</P>
                  <P>Further information is provided in the procurement documents.</P>

The Schools would wish the successful Supplier/s to review the current range of services offered and make recommendations accordingly.</P>
                  <P>The contract being tendered is for three years in duration from 1.1.2018 to 31.12.2020 and will operate as a guaranteed performance contract, with the successful Supplier offering the School a guaranteed return / cost per annum for the provision of catering services. Sovereignty of the cash tariff is to remain with the Schools for the duration of this contract.</P>
                  <P>The school year is based on a calendar of 195 days. 5 days are to be used for staff professional development which means that School will be open to receive students for the legal minimum of 190 days.</P>
                  <P>The contract offered covers the scope for the provision of all catering services within the Schools. Free School Meals and hospitality will be charged based on consumption and at net food cost.</P>
                  <P>Whilst the Schools prioritise value for money as a key objective of the competitive tender process, the governing bodies are not obliged to accept the lowest price.</P>
                  <P>The Schools expect the successful Supplier/s to enable the continued development of catering through the provision of an innovative, healthy food service, with fresh, seasonal, locally sourced ingredients being prepared on-site. The Schools expect the successful Supplier/s to evidence, through their bid, how they shall support and complement the values and support the principles of Every Child Matters.</P>
                  <P>The Schools believe that success should be celebrated and that pupils should enjoy their time at school; if lessons are stimulating and challenging then students will love learning. Much time therefore, is spent reviewing and planning schemes of work to ensure that they are differentiated to meet the needs of all students. As a result, the Schools are very enthusiastic regarding work experience and apprenticeship proposals and would welcome the input of the successful Supplier/s.</P>
                  <P>As schools who are continually seeking ways to improve and develop the ethos and environment for students and staff, to give them the facilities they deserve and need to meet the challenges of the 21st Century, any consideration regarding inward capital investment as part of Suppliers' tender submission would be welcomed.
