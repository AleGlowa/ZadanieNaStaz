               <P>Procurement of a Business Partner to support a Digital Transformation Programme.</P>
               <P>Background</P>
               <P>The local government landscape is evolving at pace:</P>
               <P>— demographic change is leading to increased &amp; complex demand on services,</P>
               <P>— new legislation is creating a greater focus on empowering communities to direct service provision &amp; to self-support,</P>
               <P>— our customers &amp; employees have increasing desire &amp; expectation to engage &amp; work digitally, flexibly &amp; mobile,</P>
               <P>— continued budgetary pressures are impacting funding of Public Services.</P>
               <P>There is a need for a significant &amp; meaningful change in the way the Authority currently operates &amp; delivers its services to adjust to this changing landscape.</P>
               <P>At the same time, we see significant advances in disruptive technologies, i.e. ultra-fast broadband, artificial intelligence and next generation smart devices; these will become increasingly sophisticated in the future. These types of digital technology could unlock ways of delivering services radically different.</P>

                  <P>North Lanarkshire Council (the Authority) has ambition to become a digital pioneer in Scotland delivering better outcomes for people, communities &amp; businesses of North Lanarkshire.</P>
                  <P>An outline business case was approved by the Authority with approval to initiate a full business case (FBC) and implementation programme for Digitising Council Services.</P>
                  <P>To achieve the ambitious vision &amp; deliver services fit for the future, the Authority is seeking a Business Partner to support our ambitious Digital Transformation Programme (DTP), work hand-in-hand with the Authority, play a major role to assist delivery of this exciting transformational change. The programme will incorporate business, cultural &amp; technology transformation.</P>
                  <P>The Business Partner will be required to provide knowledge, expertise, processes, methods, tools, people and capability.</P>
                  <P>The contractual relationship will have 2 distinct stages:</P>
                  <P>1) Detailed Design Stage, est.6-12 month duration:</P>
                  <P>(a) The initial Detailed Design Stage will have a set of distinct product outputs to be delivered including but not limited to a full detailed design and FBC.</P>
                  <P>2) Implementation Stage:</P>
                  <P>(a) The Implementation Stage will be achieved by splitting the implementation projects/activities into a set of smaller individual work packages (Statements of Work) that will be agreed and prioritised by the Authority, with defined product outputs to be delivered by the Business Partner.</P>
                  <P>The Authority will retain sole discretion as to whether the contract expires upon provision of the Detailed Design Stage distinct product outputs, or alternatively whether the contractual relationship continues to the provision by the successful bidder of the Implementation Stage product outputs.</P>
                  <P>The Business Partner should have recent significant &amp; substantial experience of digital transformation, working with organisations of a similar nature, size and complexity of the Authority.</P>
                  <P>The Business Partner will take on the role of a "Business Integrator" with responsibility for strategy and direction of systems integration. It is anticipated during the programme the Business Partner will work alongside a "System Integrator" who will be accountable for the build and development of the solution(s) with oversight.</P>
                  <P>The Business Partner resource will be expected to work predominantly onsite in Motherwell as part of an integrated team alongside Authority staff.</P>
                  <P>Requirements of the Business Partner will include but not be limited to:</P>
                  <P>— provision of a detailed design &amp; FBC for DTP,</P>
                  <P>— assisting with management &amp; governance of business and technical digital transformation,</P>
                  <P>— support of business change with objective to realise significant benefits from the programme,</P>
                  <P>— provision of successful technology design, exploiting modern disruptive technologies as enablers,</P>
                  <P>— support of procurements, including, System Integrator, Technical vendors, Services and ICT systems (compliant with the legislative rules and regulations of Public Procurement),</P>
                  <P>— management of Systems Integrator &amp; Technical vendors to develop and build a successful, cohesive architecture to support digital business transformation.</P>
                  <P>Aims are to deliver a new service model &amp; new digital platform for the Authority:</P>
                  <P>— a new business service model that removes duplication &amp; fragmentation through consolidation of common activity/processes, and diverts unwarranted demand away from costly services,</P>
                  <P>— a new corporate approach to delivery of its service through a digital transformation and streamlined end-to-end processes,</P>
                  <P>— a new corporate Cloud &amp; Digital platform and technology approach as an enabler of business transformation, outcomes and benefits for improved customer experience.</P>
                  <P>A core measure of success for the implementation programme will be the ability to enable the Authority to grow and sustain success for the next 5-15 year period. The Authority hopes much of the changes will be delivered by years 3-5. Changes can be scaled up/down depending on Authority priorities &amp; need.</P>

                  <P>(b) Fail = response is not compliant with the minimum standard stated in the Contract Notice section III.1.2) Economic and financial standing.</P>
                  <P>2) Part IV Selection Criteria, Section "C Technical and Professional Ability". Bidders must respond to ESPD Questions 4C.1.2, and 4C.10. Responses to question 4C.1.2 for technical and professional ability will be scored by an evaluation panel. Response to 4C.10 will not be evaluated.

                  <P>Evaluation on responses to Question 4C.1.2 will be conducted using the following scoring convention:</P>
                  <P>Score – Definition:</P>
                  <P>1) 100 Response is completely relevant. It is unlikely that the response could be more comprehensive or be improved upon. It provides comprehensive evidence and full assurance that the candidate fully meets the required standard in this selection criterion;</P>
                  <P>2) 90 Response is almost entirely relevant. The response is comprehensive, unambiguous and demonstrates a thorough understanding of what is required in respect of this selection criterion, and provides convincing evidence of their capacity/ability/experience in this area;</P>
                  <P>3) 80 Response is highly relevant. Detailed response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the selection criterion and provides a high level of detail as to their capacity/ability/experience in this area;</P>
                  <P>4) 70 Response is relevant. The response is sufficiently detailed to demonstrate a thorough understanding of the selection criterion and provides evidence of a reliable level of capacity/ability/experience in this area;</P>
                  <P>5) 60 Response is substantially relevant and acceptable and demonstrates a broad understanding of the selection criterion to a satisfactory depth but evidence of capacity/ability/experience in this area could have been more detailed;</P>
                  <P>6) 50 Response is at least 50 % relevant and acceptable. The response demonstrates an understanding of the selection criterion but lacks detail of evidence of capacity/ability/experience in this area;</P>
                  <P>7) 40 Response is partially relevant but evidence presented is not sufficiently detailed to demonstrate a reliable level of capacity/ability/experience in this area. There is a lack of depth of detail or understanding in many areas;</P>
                  <P>8) 30 Response has some relevance but is generally insufficient. The response addresses some elements of the requirement but contains limited evidence as to the candidate’s capacity/ability/experience in this area;</P>
                  <P>9) 20 Response demonstrates a lack of understanding and little pertinent limited evidence as to the candidate’s capacity/ability/experience in this area;</P>
                  <P>10) 10 Response demonstrates little evidence of the candidate’s understanding or explanation of the candidate’s capacity/ability/experience in this area;</P>
                  <P>11) 0 Nil/irrelevant response.</P>
                  <P>The following Question weightings apply: 4C.1.2 100 %; Example 1 70 %, Example 2 30 %.</P>
                  <P>Subject to achieving a pass for all minimum standards (aforementioned here in II.2.9), Bidders will be ranked by weighted score achieved against Part IV Selection Criteria, Section "C Technical and Professional Ability" Question 4C.1.2.
