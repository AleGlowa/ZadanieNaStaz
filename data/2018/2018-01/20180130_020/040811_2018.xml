                  <P>The University of the West of Scotland (the Client), will procure a Contractor on a SBCC D&amp;B form of contract to deliver Sport and Science teaching and research facilities on level 2 of Edzell Building. The Contractor is required to deliver a Laboratory fit out project within an operational education campus the ongoing of the New Lanarkshire Campus, which totals circa 28 199 m<FT TYPE="SUP">2</FT>.</P>
                  <P>Due for completion in two sections, this project will see the Laboratories and supporting infrastructure delivered within a shell space located within the New Campus and the contractor instructed will integrate works with the landlords Cat A installations.</P>
                  <P>Whilst a phased approach to delivery is likely to be required, the client is reviewing options and as such, we have alternative programmes within which illustrate the indicative project durations under two options, with important similarities being that the design for all works is to be delivered in a continuous phase, whilst construction may be delivered in a sectional completion basis (on a circa 70 / 30 financial split) or in a single construction period.</P>
                  <P>The Contractor’s attention is drawn to the requirement that the Consultants are appointed sub-consultants of Faithful+Gould to RIBA Stage 3. The Contractor is required to accept Novation of the agreed terms of appointment between Faithful+Gould and each sub-consultant. The Contractor will take full responsibility for the services of the Consultants and for all design produced by them, including those carried out prior to their appointment by the Contractor.</P>

                  <P>2 — Acceptable — Response is relevant and acceptable. The response demonstrates broad previous experience, knowledge and skills/capacity/capability but may lack in some aspects of similarity e.g. previous experience, knowledge or skills may not be of a similar nature.</P>
                  <P>3 — Good — Response is relevant and good. The response is sufficiently detailed to demonstrate a good amount of experience, knowledge or skills/capacity/capability relevant to providing similar services to clients.</P>

               <P>Q4B.4 The University will use the following ratios to evaluate a bidders financial status:</P>
               <P>Profitability — this is taken as profit after tax but before dividends and minority interests. If a company makes a profit then it is a pass for this ratio.</P>
               <P>Liquidity — this is calculated as current assets less stock and work in progress, divided by current liabilities. If the answer is greater than or equal to one then it is a pass for this ratio.</P>
               <P>Gearing — this is calculated as the total external secured borrowing (short term and long term) divided by shareholder funds expressed as a percentage. If the answer is less than or equal to 100 % it is considered a pass for this ratio.</P>
               <P>Bidders must provide the name and value of each of the 3 ratios within their response to ESPD Q4B.4. UWS requires bidders to pass 2 out of the 3 financial ratios above.</P>
               <P>Where 2 or 3 of the 3 ratios cannot be met, UWS may take the undernoted into consideration when assessing financial viability and the risk to UWS, providing that the Bidder can supply evidence to substantiate any of the mitigating criteria when requested to do so. The following list is not exhaustive and other criteria may be considered where proposed by a bidder as mitigating factors:</P>
               <P>Would the bidder have passed the checks if prior year accounts had been used?</P>
               <P>Were any of the poor appraisal outcomes "marginal"?</P>
               <P>Does the bidder operate in a market which, traditionally, requires lower liquidity or higher debt finance?</P>
               <P>Does the bidder have sufficient reserves to sustain losses for a number of years?</P>
               <P>Does the bidder have a healthy cashflow?</P>
               <P>Is the bidder profitable enough to finance the interest on its debt?</P>
               <P>Is most of the bidder's debt owed to group companies?</P>
               <P>Is the bidder's debt due to be repaid over a number of years, and affordable?</P>
               <P>Have the bidder's results been adversely affected by "one off costs" and / or "one off accounting treatments"?</P>
               <P>Do the bidder's auditors (where applicable) consider it to be a "going concern"?</P>
               <P>Do Dunn &amp; Bradstreet, Equifax or equivalent consider the bidder to be a "going concern"?</P>
               <P>Will the bidder provide a Parent Company Guarantee?</P>
               <P>Is the bidder the single supplier/source of the Goods/Works/Services in the marketplace?</P>
               <P>UWS will request submission of and assess the bidders financial accounts, and may use Dunn &amp; Bradstreet, Equifax or equivalent verification systems to validate the information provided.</P>
               <P>Q4B.5.1 It is a requirement of this contract that bidders hold, or can commit to obtain prior to the commence of any subsequently awarded contract, the types and levels of insurance indicated below:</P>
               <P>Employer’s (Compulsory) Liability Insurance = 10 000 000 GBP</P>
               <P>Public Liability Insurance = 10 000 000 GBP</P>
