            <INFO_ADD>
               <P>Contract Monitoring. The successful contractor’s performance on the contract will be regularly monitored. Contractors not delivering on contract requirements is a serious matter. It means the public purse is not getting what it is paying for. If a contractor fails to reach satisfactory levels of contract performance they will be given a specified time to improve. If, after the specified time, they still fail to reach satisfactory levels of contract performance, the matter will be escalated to senior management in CPD for further action. If this occurs and their performance still does not improve to satisfactory levels within the specified period, it may be regarded as an act of grave professional misconduct and they may be issued with a Certificate of Unsatisfactory Performance and the contract may be terminated. The issue of a Certificate of Unsatisfactory Performance will result in the contractor being excluded from all procurement competitions being undertaken by Centres of Procurement Expertise on behalf of bodies covered by the Northern Ireland Procurement Policy for a period of 12 months from the date of issue of the certificate. The Authority expressly reserves the rights:</P>
               <P>(I) not to award any contract as a result of the procurement process commenced by publication of this notice;</P>
               <P>(II) to make whatever changes it may see fit to the content and structure of the tendering Competition;</P>
               <P>(III) to award (a) contract(s) in respect of any part(s) of the [services] covered by this notice; and</P>
               <P>(IV) to award contract(s) in stages, and in no circumstances will the Authority be liable for any costs incurred by candidates.</P>
