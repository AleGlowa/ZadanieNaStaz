               <P>A designer cannot act as a designer for multiple applicants within the same lot.</P>
               <P>This procurement falls within the scope of HM Revenue and Customs' Construction Industry Scheme.</P>

               <P>New work to be called off under 1 Lot may require a mini-competition between all Suppliers on the framework.</P>
               <P>HE will assess the SQs to produce a single shortlist of applicants for all lots at the Selection Stage and invite suppliers to submit tenders for the Award Stage. Prior to selecting the suppliers to proceed to the Validation stage, HE will produce a ranking of suppliers that it intends to take forward and as part of that process, it will also apply the tests set out above.</P>
               <P>HE will also undertake further financial capacity tests to ensure that suppliers have the required financial standing in relation to those lots or combination of lots where it is proposed to validate the tender.</P>
               <P>HE reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to exclude tenderers at this stage or at SQ stage.</P>
               <P>Applicants must identify the lots they have applied for and clearly state their order of preference (if applying for more than one) using the form provided.

The supplier carries the financial risk of tendering for multiple lots.</P>
               <P>Applicants should note that HE sees the roles of the TAP and the DIP as a potential conflict of interest and the successful DIPs (including their design contractors) will be restricted from bidding for a TAP post that will be working on the same projects.</P>
