               <P>Portsmouth City Council (the 'Council') is seeking to establish a framework agreement for the provision of cleaning services. The agreement will be awarded by 4.9.2018 to allow for service commencement on 29.10.2018. The framework agreement will run for 4 years. Call off contracts may be let on a suggested base term of 3-5 years, extendable to a maximum term of 10 years. The Council has an immediate requirement for services at sites which equate to an estimated value of 300k GBP per annum. The agreement can also be accessed by schools (Council maintained and academies) and neighbouring Local Authorities. However, the Council can provide no guarantee of further uptake beyond the sites which have an immediate requirement. In the unlikely event that all options are taken up the total estimated spend via the framework agreement could equate to 7.9M GBP per annum. Interested parties are required to submit a completed Supplier Selection Questionnaire (SSQ) by 27.4.2018 14:00.</P>

               <SHORT_DESCR>
                  <P>Portsmouth City Council (the 'Council') is seeking to establish a framework agreement for the provision of cleaning services. The Council is aiming to establish a single provider partnership relationship with the top ranked provider from the procurement process. However, to provide for on-going contingency and flexibility a further 4 providers will also be appointed onto the framework agreement. The framework may be used to let call off contracts on either a direct award or mini-competition basis on the provision that the option of using top ranked partner provider via direct award must be investigated to the satisfaction of the framework manager before the mini-competition option can be pursued. The framework agreement will run for 4 years. Call off contracts may be let on a suggested base term of 3-5 years, extendable to a maximum term of 10 years. Longer base terms are also allowed up to maximum duration of 10 years where significant benefits can be demonstrated.</P>
                  <P>In establishing the framework agreement the Council will invite providers to submit tenders covering the following sites which have an immediate requirement for services. The estimated combined per annum contract value for the sites equates to 300K GBP. Each of the sites will contract on the basis of a 5 year base term extendable to a maximum term of 10 years.</P>

                  <P>— Wimborne Infant School.</P>
                  <P>The agreement will be available for use by all Council services, other than for those operated via the Council's Housing Revenue Account budget which has its own in house service. The agreement may also be accessed by Council Maintained Schools, Academy Schools within the City boundaries and Academy Schools outside of the City boundaries on the provision that the Academy Trust concerned is operating other schools that fall within the City boundaries.</P>
                  <P>The agreement may also be accessed by Local Authorities which neighbour the Council being:</P>
                  <P>— Gosport Borough Council,</P>
                  <P>— Fareham Borough Council,</P>

                  <P>The Council cannot provide any guarantees of further spend beyond the sites which have an immediate requirement. It should be noted that the additional sites have or are likely to have services in place and no aspiration to change these arrangements has been communicated. However, in the unlikely event that all options are taken up the total estimated spend via the framework agreement could equate to £7.9M per annum. This figure should be treated as a non-binding estimate which may be increased in order to provide full access to the agreement for Council services, schools and neighbouring local authorities. For information on how the spend estimate has been calculated together with information regarding current service arrangements where known refer to section 'VI.3) Additional Information' of this Contract Notice.</P>

               <P>In the unlikely event that all options to access the agreement are taken up by the additional Council sites, Council maintained schools, Academy schools and neighbouring Local Authorities spend via the agreement could increase by approx. £7.6M per annum. This calculation is based upon the following:</P>
               <P>— NON HRA COUNCIL SITES — 847 675 GBP  per annum. Libraries, Public Toilets, Civic Offices, Registry Office, etc. The services are currently delivered by the Council's in house HRA Green &amp; Clean Services and there is no current aspiration to depart from this arrangement.</P>
               <P>— PORTSMOUTH INTERNATIONAL PORT — 235 000  GBP per annum. The Port's current cleaning service provisions were tendered for in September 2017 and are being provided by Nviro on a 7 year contract with a 3 year option to extend. Currently there is no aspiration to depart from this arrangement.</P>
               <P>— COUNCIL MAINTAINED SCHOOLS — 1.2M  GBP per annum. Mixture of directly employed cleaners and out-sourced arrangements. Further engagement required to ascertain appetite for departure from current arrangements.</P>
               <P>— ACADEMY SCHOOLS WITHIN CITY BOUNDARIES — 820 000  GBP per annum. Mixture of directly employed cleaners and out-sourced arrangements. Further engagement required to ascertain appetite for departure from current arrangements.</P>
               <P>— ACADEMY SCHOOLS OUTSIDE OF CITY BOUNDARIES — 1M  GBP per annum. These schools may access the agreement on the provision that the Academy Trust concerned is operating other schools that fall within the City boundaries. Likely to be a mixture of directly employed cleaners and out-sourced arrangements. Further engagement required to ascertain accurate spend estimates and appetite for departure from current arrangements.</P>
               <P>— NEIGHBOURING LOCAL AUTHORITIES — 3.5M per annum.  500k GBP per annum for each of the 4 district and borough authorities - Havant, Fareham, Gosport, East Hants. 1.5M  GBP per annum for Isle of Wight unitary authority. Further engagement required to ascertain accurate spend estimates and appetite for departure from current arrangements.</P>
               <P>The above figures are to be treated as non-binding estimates which may be increased in order to provide full access to the agreement for the additional sites/ bodies listed above.</P>
