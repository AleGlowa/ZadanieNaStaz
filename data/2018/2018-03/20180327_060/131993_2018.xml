               <P>The use of the ESPD is a precondition for participation in the procurement procedure, cf. § 148 of the public procurement Act. DALO shall require that the tenderer apply the ESPD as preliminary evidence that the tenderer is not subject to the compulsory grounds of exclusion stipulated in §§ 135 and 136 or the chosen optional ground for exclusion in § 137(1)(2) of the said Act, that the tenderer fulfils the minimum requirements for suitability fixed in accordance with § 140, cf. section III.1.2) and III.1.3).</P>
               <P>The tenderers and, if relevant, the participants in the group of entities and /or supporting entities, must use the electronic version of the ESPD. DALO has prepared an ESPD (an XML-file) available at the electronic tendering system under “My response”, section “ESPD”, where the tenderer can export the file (“Export”) and save it in a local version. The tenderer must upload the XML-file to this website https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/espd/welcome where the ESPD can be completed, exported and subsequently imported to the electronic tendering system under “My response”, section “ESPD”. The tenderer may submit an ESPD for each lot. The tenderer is asked to state in the ESPD Part II, section A which lot or lots the offer concerns.</P>
               <P>Reference is made to The Danish Competition and consumer authority's guidance note “ESPD Dokumentation og e-Certis”, June 2017, available at http://www.kfst.dk/media/46438/espd-dokumentation-og-ecertis.pdf and DALO’s practical guide to completion of the ESPD found with the tender material in EU supply.</P>
               <P>A tenderer participating alone and who does not rely on the capacity of other entities shall only complete one ESPD. A tenderer participating alone who relies on the capacity of other entities shall ensure that DALO receives his own ESPD together with a separate ESPD with the relevant information for each of the entities that the tenderer relies on. Finally, when groups of entities, including temporary joint ventures, participate in the tender procedure together, each of the participating entities must complete a separate ESPD with the information required in section II-IV.</P>
               <P>Prior to decision on award of the contract, DALO shall require that the tenderer to whom DALO intends to award the contract presents documentation for the information stated in the ESPD, cf. §§ 151-155 of the said Act. If a tenderer relies on the capacity of other entities, cf. section III.1.2 and III.1.3, the tenderer shall upon request provide statements of support or other documentation proving that the tenderer has access to the necessary economic and financial standing and /or technical and professional capacity, and that the entity referred to has a legal obligation to the tenderer. If such documentation is not provided, DALO cannot consider the economic and financial standing and /or the technical and professional capacity of the other entity or entities. DALO has prepared a template to be used to confirm the legal obligation which is available at EU Supply at the link mentioned in section I.3). DALO strongly encourages the tenderers to use this form. However, it is emphasized that it is the sole responsibility of the tenderer that the information provided fulfils the requirements.</P>
               <P>DALO shall exclude a tenderer from participation in the procurement procedure, if the tenderer is subject to one of the compulsory grounds for exclusion in §§ 135 and 136 and the grounds for exclusion set out in section 137(1)(2) of the said Act unless the tenderer has provided sufficient documentation that the tenderer is reliable in accordance to § 138 of the said Act. Please note that certain voluntary exclusion grounds in Directive 2014/24/EU on public procurement have been made compulsory in § 136 of the said Act.</P>
