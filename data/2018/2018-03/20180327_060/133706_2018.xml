The tests are scheduled to take place in the autumn 2018 and are expected to be conducted at the Danish Defence locations in Denmark.</P><P>The exact method and the intended tests will be described in the tender material. DALO intends to use the framework agreement for current purchases of binoculars and LRF-binoculars, but DALO shall not be obliged to buy any minimum quantity of binoculars nor LRF-binoculars.</P></SHORT_CONTRACT_DESCRIPTION><CPV><CPV_MAIN><CPV_CODE CODE="38631000"/></CPV_MAIN><CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_CODE CODE="35800000"/></CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_CODE CODE="38000000"/></CPV_ADDITIONAL></CPV><SUBCONTRACTING><INDICATE_ANY_SHARE VALUE="NO"/><INDICATE_ANY_CHANGE VALUE="NO"/><SUBCONTRACT_AWARD_PART VALUE="NO"/><IDENTIFY_SUBCONTRACT VALUE="NO"/></SUBCONTRACTING><F17_DIVISION_INTO_LOTS><DIV_INTO_LOT_NO/></F17_DIVISION_INTO_LOTS><ACCEPTED_VARIANTS VALUE="NO"/></DESCRIPTION_CONTRACT_INFORMATION_DEFENCE><QUANTITY_SCOPE><NATURE_QUANTITY_SCOPE><COSTS_RANGE_AND_CURRENCY CURRENCY="DKK"><VALUE_COST FMTVAL="30000000">30 000 000</VALUE_COST></COSTS_RANGE_AND_CURRENCY></NATURE_QUANTITY_SCOPE><NO_OPTIONS/><NO_RECURRENT_CONTRACT/></QUANTITY_SCOPE><PERIOD_WORK_DATE_STARTING><MONTHS>84</MONTHS></PERIOD_WORK_DATE_STARTING></OBJECT_CONTRACT_INFORMATION_DEFENCE><LEFTI_CONTRACT_DEFENCE><CONTRACT_RELATING_CONDITIONS><MAIN_FINANCING_CONDITIONS><P>Reference is made to the tender documents regarding payment terms.
