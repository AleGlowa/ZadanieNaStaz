                  <P>Babcock DSG Ltd - acting as agent to the UK Ministry of Defence (“the Authority”) - has under consideration a 4 years framework agreement for the supply of food containers, food preparation, serving equipment and associated parts.</P>
                  <P>All items within the scope of requirement are codified to NATO Stock Numbers (NSNs). All items must be supplied compliant to the drawings and specifications available, which are provided as information in the supporting documentation of the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ) and will be issued with the tender documentation. Where drawings and specifications are not available, the Manufacturer's Part Number (MPN) as stated on the Codification Support Information System (CSIS) is to be supplied. The MPN supplied must accurately reflect a valid reference to the NSN as listed on CSIS and the source of supply being from the corresponding NATO Commercial And Government Entity (NCAGE). As a guideline, 3:2 and 5:2 references are preferable, and 3:9 and 5:9 references are deemed as obsolete references unless written evidence can be provided to the contrary.</P>

                  <P>Expressions of interest to participate in this requirement are to be submitted on Defence Contracts Online (DCO) by completing the PQQ. The PQQ shall be assessed on DCO using the selection criteria given within the PQQ and within each question. It is the intention of the authority to down select to between 5 and 10 economic operators who will be invited to tender. Only those suppliers who provide all mandatory information and are not subject to a mandatory exclusion will be invited to tender. Access to the PQQ requires a code, which is S77C2ZT489</P>
                  <P>An electronic copy of the tender documentation is provided on the supporting documents tab of the PQQ. These documents are for information only and you are not required to comment or respond to them. You should only submit a response to the PQQ.</P>
                  <P>In accordance with the government's transparency agenda, the authority shall publish the tender and contract documents online. Further guidance shall be provided with the ITT.</P>
