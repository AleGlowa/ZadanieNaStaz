                  <P>Responsive repairs and maintenance to west ward – Lot 1a and east ward lot 1b contracts.</P>
                  <P>Responsive repairs and maintenance Service including emergency and adhoc major repairs in our occupied properties, communal blocks and estate areas, sheltered housing, community centres owned and managed by Ealing Council and corporate buildings operated by Ealing Facilities Management. There will be some planned maintenance works, such as guttering and some out of hour’s emergency work. It is to provide a 365 days’ a year, 24 hours a day front line service for and on behalf of Ealing Council. Note: Out of hour’s emergency work means ONLY repairs that are necessary to remove immediate danger, avoid flooding, major damage to property, or to make the property secure. Ealing Council will enter into a contract based upon the JCT Measured Term Contract (MTC) 2016, as amended and incorporating the documents stated in the tender package. It is the intention to award contracts to 2 contractors as detailed below.</P>
                  <P>The successful tenderer who scores highest in the tender evaluation will be allocated their preferred area / ward and the second most successful tenderer in the evaluation will be allocated the other area / ward. A Contractor will only be appointed to 1 area / ward and not both. The intention is if a Contractor fails delivery due to failure or performance matters in their designated area/ward the Contract will be given to the other Contractor to cover both area / wards for the remainder of the Contract life if they confirm they have the ability to do so. The expected value of each contract will be approximately 1 500 000 GBP to 2 000 000 GBP per annum for each area / ward. Guarantee cannot be given by Ealing Council with regard to the volume, trade requirement, value, duration, category nor continuity of the works.The borough will be split into 2 areas / wards with roughly equal numbers of blocks. The East area comprises W3, W4, W5, W7, W13 and NW10 postcodes. The West comprises UB1, UB2, UB5, UB6, HA0, HA4 and a small number of BN25 postcodes. Some stock is within areas identified for regeneration and development, this is likely to mean that there will be some change in the overall number of blocks and also lead on supply and demand of works during the life of the contract.The overall contract length for all above lots will be for the period of 5 years, unless extended by the Employer with the agreement of the Contractor. The Employer may propose one or more extensions to the contract period up to a maximum of 2 further years by serving written notice to that effect on the Contractor. The contract period is extended if the Contractor agrees to the extension.If you are tendering for multiple lots you will be required to indicate in your tender submission which is your preferred lot as only one lot will be awarded per contractor.</P>

                  <P>Copley close responsive repairs and maintenance contract (Falls within east ward) – Lot 2.</P>
                  <P>Responsive repairs and maintenance Service including emergency and ad-hoc major repairs in occupied properties, communal blocks and estate areas and community centre in our Copley Close Housing Stock which has approximately 370 properties. There will be some out of hour’s emergency work. Note: Out of hour’s emergency work means ONLY repairs that are necessary to remove immediate danger, avoid flooding, major damage to property, or to make the property secure. Ealing Council will enter into a contract based upon the JCT Measured Term Contract (MTC) 2016, as amended and incorporating the documents stated in the tender package. It is the intention to award the contract to a single contractor. The expected value of the contract will be approximately 400 000 GBP to 600 000 GBP total spend per annum. Guarantee cannot be given by Ealing Council with regard to the volume, trade requirement, value, duration, category nor continuity of the works. This estate is currently undergoing redevelopment, this is likely to mean that there will be some change in the overall volume of work. The overall contract length for all above lots will be for the period of 5 years, unless extended by the Employer with the agreement of the Contractor. The Employer may propose 1 or more extensions to the contract period up to a maximum of 2 further years by serving written notice to that effect on the Contractor. The contract period is extended if the Contractor agrees to the extension. If you are tendering for multiple lots you will be required to indicate in your tender submission which is your preferred lot as only one lot will be awarded per contractor.</P>

                  <P>Ealing Council would like to draw to the Tenderers attention that during the Contract Period there is a possibility that delivery of the services may be required to its wholly owned subsidiary companies or future companies in which the Council has an interest via Ealing Council. In the event of this occurring the contract terms may require variation, for example, but not limited to, the insurance provisions.</P>
