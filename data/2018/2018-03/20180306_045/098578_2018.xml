               <P>The principal contracting authority (i.e. the Council of the Borough of Kirklees) is the only contracting authority that will enter into any framework agreement with the successful economic operators. The other contracting authorities listed in Section I.1 of this Notice above shall be permitted to use the Framework Agreement to call-off contracts in relation to the Lot relevant to each individual contracting authority. In addition, the Framework Agreement may be used by any of the other “Local Authorities” (as defined under the Local Government Act 1972 (SI 1972/070)) within the Yorkshire and Humber Region. A map and list of the other Local Authorities permitted to use the Framework Agreement can be found in Appendix 1 of File 01 of the procurement documentation (available to download at https://www.yortender.co.uk/procontract/supplier.nsf). The principal contracting authority considers that this Framework Agreement may be suitable for economic operators that are small or medium enterprises (“SMEs”). However, any selection of economic operators will be based solely on the criteria set out for the procurement, and the Framework Agreement will be awarded on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender based on lowest price only. The award criteria is set out in the procurement documentation (available to download at https://www.yortender.co.uk/procontract/supplier.nsf). With regards to the estimated total value of works for the entire duration of the Framework Agreement, please note the values stipulated in Section II.1.5 of this Notice above covers the potential spend of all the participating contracting authorities, throughout the duration of the Framework Agreement. Notwithstanding the range of values stipulated in Section II.1.5, however, for the avoidance of doubt please note that:</P>
               <P>i) The estimates given in Section II.1.5 of this Notice are strictly estimated values only.</P>
               <P>ii) Any information supplied in the Tender Documents as to the likely volumes of works or the times when they are likely to be required are given purely as indication of past experiences of the contracting authorities.</P>
               <P>iii) Furthermore, please note that estimates given in Section II.1.5 of this Notice are based on third party estimates of anticipated future workloads during the Framework Period as at the date of this Notice, and the principal contracting authority gives no warranty as to the accuracy to said data.</P>
               <P>iv) The anticipated usage of this Framework Agreement is unknown at present. Tenderers should note that it is not possible to establish an exact future workload and it is therefore not possible to guarantee that all or any of the successful economic operators with whom the principal contracting authority enters into theFramework Agreement will in fact be called upon to execute Works on behalf of the principal contracting authority or any of the other contracting authorities. Unless otherwise specifically stated elsewhere in theTender Documents,there is no minimum or maximum value/quantity of Works that may be ordered on any one occasion and the rates tendered must therefore reflect the likelihood of varying magnitude of Works and types of Works.</P>
               <P>v) No contracting authority is bound to enter into any Task Order or other contract following discussions or other representations and no contracting authority shall incur any liability in respect of any failure to enter into any Work Contract or in connection with the total volume, type of Works or value of Works anticipated by any of the economic operators or which any economic operator is asked to carry out.</P>

            <REVIEW_PROCEDURE>
               <P>In accordance with Regulation 86 (Notices of decisions to award a contract or conclude a framework agreement), Regulation 87 (Standstill periods) and Chapter 6 (Applications to Court) of the Public Contract Regulations 2015 (SI 2015/102), the principal contracting authority has incorporated a minimum ten (10) calendar day standstill period at the point that information on the conclusion of the Framework Agreement was communicated to economic operators. This period allowed any unsuccessful economic operator(s) to seek further debriefing from the contracting authority before the award (or non-award) of the Framework Agreement. Such additional information should have been (and can still be) requested from the address at Sections I.1 and I.3 of this Notice above. If an appeal regarding the award (or non-award) of the Framework Agreement has not been successfully resolved, then the Regulations provide for aggrieved parties who have been harmed or are at risk of harm by a breach of the rules to take action in the High Court (England, Wales and Northern Ireland). Any such action must be started within thirty (30) days beginning with the date when the aggrieved party first knew or sought to have grounds for starting the proceedings had arisen. The Court may extend the time limited for starting proceedings where the Court considers that there is a good reason for doing so, but not so as to permit proceedings to be started more than three (3) months after that date. Where the Framework agreement has not been awarded, the Court may order the setting aside of the award decision or order the contracting authority to amend any document and may award damages. If however the Framework Agreement has been awarded, the Court may only award damages or, where the contract award procedures have not been followed correctly, declare the Framework Agreement to be ineffective.</P>
