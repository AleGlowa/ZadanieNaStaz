               <P>Pass = response is compliant with the minimum requirement stated in the Contract Notice Section 3.1.1 (Suitability).</P>
               <P>Fail = response is not compliant with the minimum requirement stated in the Contract Notice Section 3.1.1 (Suitability).</P>

               <P>The scoring rationale of the evaluation panel for Question 4C.1 is as follows:</P>
               <P>Score — Definition</P>
               <P>100 — Response is completely relevant. It is unlikely that the response could be more comprehensive or be improved upon. It provides comprehensive evidence and full assurance that the candidate fully meets the required standard in this selection criterion</P>
               <P>90 — Response is almost entirely relevant. The response is comprehensive, unambiguous and demonstrates a thorough understanding of what is required in respect of this selection criterion, and provides convincing evidence of their capacity / ability / experience in this area</P>
               <P>80 — Response is highly relevant. Detailed response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the selection criterion and provides a high level of detail as to their capacity / ability / experience in this area</P>
               <P>70 — Response is relevant. The response is sufficiently detailed to demonstrate a thorough understanding of the selection criterion and provides evidence of a reliable level of capacity / ability / experience in this area</P>
               <P>60 — Response is substantially relevant and acceptable and demonstrates a broad understanding of the selection criterion to a satisfactory depth but evidence of capacity / ability / experience in this area could have been more detailed</P>
               <P>50 — Response is at least 50% relevant and acceptable. The response demonstrates an understanding of the selection criterion but lacks detail of evidence of capacity / ability / experience in this area</P>
               <P>40 — Response is partially relevant but evidence presented is not sufficiently detailed to demonstrate a reliable level of capacity / ability / experience in this area. There is a lack of depth of detail or understanding in many areas</P>
               <P>30 — Response has some relevance but is generally insufficient. The response addresses some elements of the requirement but contains limited evidence as to the candidate’s capacity / ability / experience in this area</P>
               <P>20 — Response demonstrates a lack of understanding and little pertinent limited evidence as to the candidate’s capacity/ability/experience in this area</P>
               <P>10 — Response demonstrates little evidence of the candidate’s understanding or explanation of the candidate’s capacity / ability / experience in this area</P>
               <P>0 — Nil or irrelevant response.</P>
               <P>4C.10. If the bidder has decided to subcontract a part of the contract and relies on the subcontractor’s capacities to perform that part then a separate ESPD for such subcontractors must be completed for sections:</P>
               <P>Part II Information concerning the bidder:</P>
               <P>A: Information about the bidder.</P>
               <P>B: Information about representatives of the bidder.</P>
               <P>Part III Exclusions Grounds:</P>
               <P>A: Grounds Relating to Criminal Convictions.</P>
               <P>B: Grounds Relating to the payment of taxes or social security contributions.</P>
               <P>C: Blacklisting.</P>
               <P>D: Grounds Relating to insolvency, conflicts of interests or professional misconduct.</P>
