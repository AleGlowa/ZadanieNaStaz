framework agreement regarding the acquisition of stand-alone shot detection systems. The framework agreement will have a duration of 4 (four) years with the option for renewal of the agreement 3 (three) times of 1 (one) year's duration.</P><P>The shot detection systems will be used by the Danish Defence in both domestic and international missions to provide warnings to the crew when a supersonic round is passing the vehicle. The system shall be able to geo-reference the location of the enemy shooters.</P><P>The system shall be a stand-alone system and work autonomously from other systems. By a stand-alone system, DALO means a shot detection system which consists of all the required components to identify,recognize and geo-reference the location of an enemy shooter, without the use of input from other 3rd party systems. Examples of 3rd party systems are Battle Management Systems, INU and/or GPS feeds (power is not considered 3rd party equipment).</P><P>The size of one sensor unit shall not exceed (H x W x L) 20 cm x 40 cm x 40 cm, as anonymity/discretion is required in some operations. The system will on an ad hoc basis be installed on different vehicles — both civilian and military non-armored vehicles.</P><P>The shot detection system is expected to operate both day and night in a variety of weather and climatic conditions ranging from freezing snowy conditions, through temperate wet and foggy conditions to hot conditions. The system shall furthermore be able to cope with i.a.vibrations and electromagnetic fields around the vehicles.</P><P>The system will be used on wheeled vehicles.</P><P>The framework agreement also covers related services including education, software updates and service, and support.</P></SHORT_CONTRACT_DESCRIPTION><CPV><CPV_MAIN><CPV_CODE CODE="35000000"/></CPV_MAIN><CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_CODE CODE="35120000"/></CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_CODE CODE="35710000"/></CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_ADDITIONAL><CPV_CODE CODE="35400000"/></CPV_ADDITIONAL></CPV><SUBCONTRACTING><INDICATE_ANY_SHARE VALUE="NO"/><INDICATE_ANY_CHANGE VALUE="NO"/><SUBCONTRACT_AWARD_PART VALUE="NO"/><IDENTIFY_SUBCONTRACT VALUE="NO"/></SUBCONTRACTING><F17_DIVISION_INTO_LOTS><DIV_INTO_LOT_NO/></F17_DIVISION_INTO_LOTS><ACCEPTED_VARIANTS VALUE="NO"/></DESCRIPTION_CONTRACT_INFORMATION_DEFENCE><QUANTITY_SCOPE><NATURE_QUANTITY_SCOPE><COSTS_RANGE_AND_CURRENCY CURRENCY="DKK"><RANGE_VALUE_COST><LOW_VALUE FMTVAL="1000000">1 000 000</LOW_VALUE><HIGH_VALUE FMTVAL="6000000">6 000 000</HIGH_VALUE></RANGE_VALUE_COST></COSTS_RANGE_AND_CURRENCY></NATURE_QUANTITY_SCOPE><RECURRENT_CONTRACT><NUMBER_POSSIBLE_RENEWALS>3</NUMBER_POSSIBLE_RENEWALS></RECURRENT_CONTRACT></QUANTITY_SCOPE></OBJECT_CONTRACT_INFORMATION_DEFENCE><LEFTI_CONTRACT_DEFENCE><CONTRACT_RELATING_CONDITIONS><MAIN_FINANCING_CONDITIONS><P>Reference is made to the tender documents regarding payment terms.

When specifying the date for each delivery, the candidate should state the date for the commencement and completion of the delivery. If this is not possible, e.g. because the delivery in question is performed on an ongoing basis according to a framework agreement, the description of the delivery should nonetheless contain information on how the date is set.</P><P>Please note that a candidate may rely on the technical and professional capacity of other entities (e.g. a parent or sister company or a sub-supplier), irrespective of the legal nature of the relations between the candidate and the entity or entities on which the candidate relies.</P></T_CAPACITY_INFORMATION><T_CAPACITY_MIN_LEVEL><P>The candidate must demonstrate experience with as a minimum 1 (one) similar delivery within the past 5 (five) years prior to the deadline for the request to participate.</P><P>Similiar deliveries mean, deliveries of shot detection systems, where the shot detection sensor unit shall not exceed (H x W x L) 20 cm x 40 cm x 40 cm.</P></T_CAPACITY_MIN_LEVEL></TECHNICAL_CAPACITY_LEFTI></F17_CONDITIONS_FOR_PARTICIPATION></LEFTI_CONTRACT_DEFENCE><PROCEDURE_DEFINITION_CONTRACT_NOTICE_DEFENCE><TYPE_OF_PROCEDURE_DEFENCE><TYPE_OF_PROCEDURE_DETAIL_FOR_CONTRACT_NOTICE_DEFENCE><PT_NEGOTIATED_CHOICE/></TYPE_OF_PROCEDURE_DETAIL_FOR_CONTRACT_NOTICE_DEFENCE><MAXIMUM_NUMBER_INVITED><OPE_ENVISAGED_NUMBER>5</OPE_ENVISAGED_NUMBER><OPE_OBJECTIVE_CRITERIA><P>The limitation of candidates will be based on an evaluation of those candidates that have documented the most relevant previous deliveries in comparison to the contract/purchases described in section II.1.5) above.
