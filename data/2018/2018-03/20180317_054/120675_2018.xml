               <P>It is particularly important that such tenderers can document a sufficient workforce to fulfill the contract, including professional and technical competence. For newly established tenderers, emphasis is put on the fact that it is the tenderer´s ability as such to fulfill the contract that will be assessed, not individual persons' competence seen in isolation.</P>
               <P>If a newly established tenderer has experience from contracts, the most relevant contracts that the tenderer has experience from shall be added, in accordance with the documentation requirements in point 2. This applies even if the contracts are of such a nature that they do not fulfill the stated requirements.</P>
               <P>Missing or insufficient documentation for 1 or several criteria can lead to a tenderer being rejected. A missing or incorrectly completed reply form can also lead to rejection, cf. § 24-1 (2) letter b).</P>
               <P>The contracting authority has made an ESPD form available for the competition notice, which all tenderers must fill in and submit together with the tender, cf. § 17-1.</P>
               <P>If several suppliers participate in the competition in cooperation, and /or the tenderer relies on the capacity of other businesses, all the companies involved shall complete a form.</P>
               <P>The ESPD form applies as provisional documentation for fulfilment of the qualification requirements, as well as there not being other reasons for rejection.</P>
               <P>Tenderers shall document fulfilment of the qualification requirements through:</P>
               <P>1— a completed ESPD form,</P>
               <P>2— a completed reply form, as stated in chapter E,</P>
               <P>3— the requested documents under the documentation requirement for each qualification requirement cf. the provisions below.</P>
               <P>Documentation as requested in accordance with nos. 1, 2, 3 and 3 shall be delivered as part of the tender by the tender deadline, cf. chapter B3 point 2.1.</P>
               <P>It is important for assessment that the information in the documentation is correct and complete. Incorrect, misguiding or missing information can lead to rejection, cf. § 24-2 (3) letter g.</P>
               <P>The contracting authority's assessment of whether tenderers fulfill the qualification requirements will, as a starting point, only be based on the submitted documentation, including any provided references. The contracting authority reserves the right to place weight on any suitable experience (positive and negative) with the tenderer (and any collaborating company, cf. point 4). The equivalent applies for other public contracting authorities' experience. The contracting authority's right to request further information and clarifications is stated in point 7 with a further referral.</P>
               <P>Chapter B3 point 6 applies equivalently in the assessment of the tenderer's qualification requirements.</P>
            </SUITABILITY>

               <P>— each individual supplier in the cooperation shall submit the same documentation that is required for individual tenderers.</P>
               <P>The supplier group can rely on the capacity of the participants in the group and, if necessary, rely on other companies, in this case, the requirements in point 1 apply in addition.</P>
               <P>The contracting authority will assess each individual participant in the group in terms of the rejection provisions, cf. § 24-2 following. This, with the exception of the provision in § 24-2 (1) letter a) (fulfilment of qualification requirements), which will be applied to the group as a whole.</P>

               <P>The contracting authorities ask that all tenderers are aware that if they are chosen as a supplier, the contracting authority will, when the competition is concluded, request equivalent tax and VAT certificates to that which the tenderer himself presented for each sub-supplier who will carry out work under the contract for more than NOK 500 000 excluding VAT, cf. the procurement regulations § 7.2 third section.</P>
               <P>Tenderers can, if necessary, rely on other companies´ capacity to fulfil the economic and financial capacity requirements and/or the technical and professional qualification requirements stated in point 2.3 and 2.4 below, cf. § 16-10 (1).</P>
