               <P>The tenderer must have had a general yearly turnover of at least 20 000 000 DK in each of the last 3 (three) financial years. If the turnover is not stated in said currency, DALO will calculate the turnover based on the official exchange rate on the date this notice was published.</P>
               <P>If the tenderer is composed of a group of entities (e.g. consortium), including temporary joint ventures, the general yearly turnover is calculated as the sum of all the participants general yearly turnover in each of the last 3 (three) financial years available.</P>
               <P>If the tenderer relies on the economic and financial standing of an entity or entities, the general yearly turnover will be calculated as the sum of the tenderer’s general yearly turnover and the entity or entities’ general yearly turnover in each of the last 3 (three) financial years available.</P>

               <P>The tenderer must use the European Single Procurement Document (electronic version, hereafter ESPD) and provide the following information in the ESPD: A list of the most important similar deliveries (references), cf. Section II.1.4) and II.2.4), carried out within the past 3 (three) years, prior to the deadline for the submission of the offer, cf. Part IV, section C. The list should preferably include a short description of each delivery. The description should include a clear indication of which specific parts of the deliveries that are similar to the supplies as described in Section II.1.4) and II.2.4). The description should include a description of the tenderers participation/role in the performance of the deliveries.</P>
               <P>The description should also contain information on the date of the deliveries, the size and value of the deliveries, the recipients of the deliveries (specific names/countries are preferred, but not necessary; if no country specific information is included, the tenderer is asked to provide as much generic information as possible about the delivery) and services and training provided in connection with the deliveries (if any). When specifying the date for the deliveries, the tenderer should state the date of commencement and completion. If this is not possible, e.g. because the delivery in question is performed on an ongoing basis according to a framework agreement, the description of the deliveries should nonetheless contain information on how the date is set.</P>
               <P>Only the deliveries (references) performed at the time of the deadline for the submission of the offer will be considered when assessing if the minimum requirement for suitability stated below is fulfilled. If the delivery in question is ongoing, it is only the part of the supplies carried out within the past 3 (three) years and completed at the time of the deadline for submission of the offer which will be included in the assessment of the delivery (reference). Consequently, if a part of the supplies has not been carried out within the past 3 (three) years, or if a part of the supplies has not been completed at the time of deadline for submission of the offer, this particular part will not be included in the assessment of the delivery (reference). Therefore, it is important that the tenderer clearly states which part of an ongoing delivery (reference) that has been carried out within the past 3 (three) years. The list must contain a maximum of 5 previous deliveries whether the tenderer is one entity, composed of a group of entities (e.g. consortium), including temporary joint ventures or relies on the technical and professional capacity of other entities. If the list contains more than 5, DALO will only consider the first 5 deliveries on the list. Deliveries beyond this number will be disregarded.</P>
               <P>A tenderer may rely on the technical and professional capacity of other entities (e.g. a parent or sister company or a subsupplier), irrespective of the legal nature of the relations between the tenderer and the entity or entities on which the tenderer relies. In this case, the tenderer shall ensure that an ESPD from the entity or entities on which the tenderer relies is submitted along with the tenderer’s own ESPD. The entity or entities’ ESPD must equally provide the information listed above.</P>
               <P>The tenderer will not be required to present further documentation for the technical and professional capacity (i.e. the information stated in the ESPD is considered sufficient). However, DALO reserves the right to contact the tenderer and/or the recipients of the deliveries in order to verify the information stated in Part IV, section C in the ESPD, including details on the specified dates of the performance of the deliveries.</P>
