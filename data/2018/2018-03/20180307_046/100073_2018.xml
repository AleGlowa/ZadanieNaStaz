Albania does not have a significant natural gas production and is currently not connected with any of the regional natural gas networks. The upcoming Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) is expected to be a cornerstone of Albania’s gasification.</P><P>Assignment description: The Client now intends to select and contract a consulting company (the “Consultant”) to provide assistance in the form of capacity building for its legal and regulatory function (the “Assignment”).</P><P>The main objectives of the Assignment are:</P><P>1) capacity building of Albgaz with a view to strengthening its legal and regulatory unit;</P><P>2) tasks to operationalise the tariff methodology and tariffs;</P><P>3) tasks to operationalise the network code (in particular, facilitating access to the network, including capacity allocation and balancing); and</P><P>4) assistance to enhance network planning functions within Albgaz (including planning capital expenditure).</P><P>The Assignment will consist of 2 phases. The commencement of Phase II will be conditional on the successful completion of Phase I deliverables.
