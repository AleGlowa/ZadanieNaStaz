               <P>The intention behind the framework is to establish multi-discipline Landscaping framework.</P>
               <P>This framework is being established primarily to support Peabody with the redevelopment of Thamesmead. Peabody acquired Thamesmead in 2014 and are developing ambitious plans for its regeneration and development. A key part of Thamesmead’s identity are its existing extensive landscape assets and it is recognised that the development of both these and new areas of landscape and public realm will be critical to ensuring the long-term success of the plans.</P>
               <P>Full details can be found at — www.thamesmeadnow.org.uk</P>
               <P>In addition to the requirements defined above the framework will also be open to Member organisations of Procurement for housing.</P>
