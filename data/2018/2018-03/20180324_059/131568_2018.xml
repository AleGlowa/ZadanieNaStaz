               <P>Each reference is requested to include a brief description of the delivery performed. The delivery description should include a clear description of the service set out in sections II.1.4 and II.2.4 to which the delivery related and the candidate's role(s) in the performance of the delivery. The delivery description should moreover include the date of the delivery and the name of the customer (recipient). When indicating the date of the delivery, it should be the date when the delivery was commenced and finalised. If that is not possible, e.g. if the tasks were performed on an ongoing basis under a framework agreement, the candidate is asked to indicate in the description of the delivery how the date is specified. The delivery description shall include the financial value of the delivery (amount) of each reference. No more than 5 references may be stated irrespective of whether the candidate is a single operator, whether the candidate relies on the technical capacity of other entities, or whether the candidate is a group of operators (e.g. a consortium). If more than 5 references are stated, only the first 5 references will be taken into account. Any additional references will be disregarded. If it is not possible to determine which references are the first 5 references, the references will be selected by the drawing of lots. If the candidate relies on the professional experience of other entities for the performance of specific parts of the services comprised by the contract, see section II.2.4, such specific parts of the services under the contract must be performed by the entity on which the candidate relies. The ESPD serves as provisional documentation that the candidate fulfils the minimum suitability requirements in respect of technical and professional capacity, as specified in this section III.1.3). Before the decision to award the contract is made, the tenderer to whom the contracting authority intends to award the contract must submit documentation that the information stated in the ESPD is accurate. No additional documentation of technical and professional capacity will be required from the candidate. However, the contracting authority reserves the right to contact the candidate or the customer indicated in the reference for confirmation of the information stated in the reference, including the dates of the reference indicated. Where an operator relies on the capacity of other entities (e.g. a parent company, sister company or a sub-contractor) regardless of the legal nature of the links between the operator and such other entities, the operator must include documentation in its tender that it will have at its disposal the resources necessary for the performance of the contract by producing an undertaking of support or other documentation that the candidate has in fact at its disposal the required technical and professional capacity. It must be documented that the entity in question is legally bound towards the candidate. Failing this, the contracting authority will not take into account the capacity of other entities. The contracting authority has drawn up a template for the undertaking of support that the candidate may use.</P>

The applicants are however always encouraged to keep themselves updated in the system on an ongoing basis.</P>
               <P>Applications should be submitted using the ESPD XML file available via the link set out in section I.3. The ESPD is completed via: https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/espd/filter?lang=da. Here the applicant is to upload the XML file, complete it and subsequently save it locally. The completed ESPD (XML file) preferably along with supporting documentation for the claims provided in the ESPD, unless it is publicly and electronically accessible free of charge, must be uploaded in the tendering system before the time limit stated in section IV.2.2) (“Local time” refers to Danish time (i.e. currently Central European Time (CET), UTC +1)).</P>
               <P>The Contracting Authority shall exclude an economic operator from participation in a procurement procedure where it has established that the applicant is covered by the exclusion grounds listed in the Danish Public Procurement Act, (Udbudsloven) §135 and §136 (EU Directive 2014/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, article 57(1)-(3), and article 57(4) (e),(f) and (h).)

Entities from other EU member states may identify the relevant certificate(s) using the online platform e-Certis. Where the country in question does not issue such documents or certificates, or where these do not cover all the cases specified, they may be replaced by a declaration on oath or, in countries where there is no provision for declarations on oath, by a solemn declaration made by the person concerned before a competent judicial or administrative authority, a notary or a competent professional or trade body, in the country of origin or in the country where the economic operator is established.</P>
               <P>Re. II.1.6): This contract has not been split into lots as the size and character of the services to be provided makes it unsuitable for distributing over several lots.</P>
