            <SHORT_DESCR>
               <P>Transport Scotland, an agency of Scottish Government, contracts in the name of and on behalf of the Scottish Ministers. It has identified a requirement to appoint suitably experienced and qualified Economic Operators (consultants) to provide specialist advice and services relative to its Trunk Road projects.</P>
               <P>It has been concluded that this requirement would be best met with a multi-supplier framework agreement over a 4 year period, whereby works of varied size, value and complexity can be individually called-off as required.</P>
               <P>To accommodate the various work types, the framework will be divided into 2 lots:</P>
               <P>— Lot 1: services relating to dispute / claims advice,</P>
               <P>— Lot 2: services relating to quantification and cost estimation services.</P>
               <P>The framework agreement shall be procured through a competitive tender procedure in accordance with the Restricted Procedure as detailed in the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2015.</P>
               <P>Further information on Transport Scotland is accessed at: www.transport.gov.scot.</P>
