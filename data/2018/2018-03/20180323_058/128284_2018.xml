               <P>Derby City Council, on behalf of Kingsmead School, now wishes to invite applications for inclusion on a Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) for these services. By creating a DPS we will give Kingsmead School the flexibility of allowing new organisations to join at any time over the course of the DPS, subject to them meeting the initial suitability criteria which will be set out in the DPS.</P>
               <P>All service requirements over the course of the DPS will then be tendered by way of mini-competition, allowing all organisations on the DPS at that time the opportunity to bid for the requirements at what would be a market appropriate rate at that time.</P>

                  <P>Kingsmead School in Derby has a statutory duty to make arrangements for the provision of suitable education otherwise than at school for children of compulsory school age who, by reason of exclusion from school or otherwise, will not receive a suitable education without these arrangements.</P>
                  <P>Derby City Council, on behalf of Kingsmead School, now wishes to invite applications for inclusion on a Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) for these services. By creating a DPS we will give Kingsmead School the flexibility of allowing new organisations to join at any time over the course of the DPS, subject to them meeting the initial suitability criteria which will be set out in the DPS.</P>
                  <P>An EU Light Touch procurement tender exercise which is compliant with the Public Contract Regulations 2015 will be undertaken to select providers for the DPS which will offer access to pre-approved DPS Providers who can be appointed using an efficient and streamlined procurement process; therefore ensuring the Council obtains value for money whilst enabling objectives to be achieved.</P>
                  <P>For clarity, this DPS is not a full DPS as defined under the public contract Regulations 2015, Regulation 34, but is a modified version. This is because Section 7 - Education and Training services (the light touch regime as allowed under Regulations 74 to 77) are not subject to the full regulations of the procurement procedures set out in the Regulations.</P>
                  <P>All service requirements over the course of the DPS will then be tendered by way of mini-competition, allowing all organisations on the DPS at that time the opportunity to bid for the requirements at what would be a market appropriate rate at that time.</P>
                  <P>Although primarily for the use of Kingsmead School, other free schools, academies and independent schools within the city of Derby may access the DPS with the support of Kingsmead School.</P>
                  <P>The DPS will operate from 1.6.2018 to 31.5.2020.</P>
                  <P>Round 1 applications close at 10:00 am on 24.4.2018 with applications assessed by 31.5.2018.</P>
                  <P>Round 2 will open 24.4.2018, close at 10:00 am on 31.7.2018 with applications assessed by 31.8.2018.</P>
                  <P>Round 3 will open 31.7.2018, close at 10:00 am on 30.9.2018 with applications assessed by 31.10.2018.</P>
                  <P>Further rounds will operate on a similar 2 monthly basis.</P>
                  <P>There are options for annual extensions for a further 5 years beyond 31.5.2020.</P>
                  <P>The maximum budget for this procurement is 750 000 GBP per annum for Kingsmead School. Further spend may be required by other schools within the city who may wish to use the DPS, with Kingsmead School's help, to also secure alternative education provision. This is not expected to be in excess of 200 000 GBP per annum.</P>
