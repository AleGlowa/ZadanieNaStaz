The route of the pipeline starts from the Central Junction Manhole (CJM), located at the outskirts of the village Lipkovo and extends to villages Otlja, Matejce, Ropalce, Vistica and Nikustak. The total length of the entire pipeline connector is 7875,98m. From the chainage 0+000,00 to the chainage 3+854,90 at the exit of the village Matejce in the direction towards the village Ropalce, the pipeline connector is already under construction. The subject of this project is the supply main from the chainage 3+854,90 to 7+054,66 with total length of 3199,76m. The remaining 821,32 m from this pipeline to the chainage 7+875,98 are not subject to this project.</P><P>Manholes for making connections are provided for connecting the settlements of WSS Lipkovo. In this area there is only one manhole for making connections for the settlement Ropalce. The water supply of the villages Vistica i Nikustak is envisaged to be carried out from a common distribution manhole at the site of the current manhole for making connections Vistica. Because of the changes it is not envisaged to be carried out according to this project, but according to the project from point 5. Supply main from manhole for making connections Vistica to Nikustak reservoir.</P><P>2 Hydro–mechanical equipment for metering and regulation manholes</P><P>Supply main from pipeline connector 2 from the CJM on the chainage 0+000,00 to the exit from the village Matejce on the chainage 3+854,90 is in the construction phase, the supply main from pipeline connector 3 from the CJM on the chainage 0+000,00 to the manhole for making connections Slupcane 4+150.10, is already performed. Only the construction works were included in the implementation of these projects, the hydro-mechanical equipment was not included. Therefore the goal of this project is to assemble and put into use the metering and regulation equipment in these manholes. In total there are envisaged three such manholes. On pipeline connector 2 is envisaged one metering and regulation manhole. It is located right after the CJM towards Otlja. On the pipeline connector 3 are envisaged two metering and regulation manholes, the first right after CJM towards Orizare, while the second is located right after junction manhole towards the settlement Opae and pipeline connector 4.</P><P>3 Supply main pipeline connector 3 from km 4+150.10 to km 12+671.52</P><P>Supply main pipeline connector 3 is part of the main distribution pipelines of WSS Lipkovo. The route of the pipeline starts from CJM and extends towards the villages Orizare, Slupcane, Vaksince and Llojane. The total length of the entire pipeline connector is 12 671,52 m. From chainage 0+000,00 to chainage 4+150,10 (manhole for making connections Slupcane), the pipeline is already constructed. The subject of this project is the supply main from chainage 4+150,10 to 12+671,52 with total length of 8 521,42 m.</P><P>Manholes for making connections are envisaged in order to connect the settlements of WSS Lipkovo. In this area there is only one manhole for making connections for settlement Vistica. The pipeline ends with a merger with the existing reservoir in the settlement Lojane.</P><P>4 Supply main pipeline connector 4</P><P>From supply main pipeline connector 3 through the junction manhole is divided a separate supply main pipeline connector 4, towards the settlement Opae. The route of the pipeline starts from the manhole for making connections Opae towards the newly envisaged reservoir Opae, after which it returns in parallel to the same ditch return pipeline. This pipeline intersects the supply main pipeline connector 3 and continues towards the settlement Opae. The subject of this project is that part of the pipeline from the intersection with pipeline connector 3 towards the settlement Opae. The remaining part from the manhole for making connection Opae to the reservoir of Opae and the return pipeline until the intersection with pipeline connector 3 will be the goal of a separate project that will define the exact location of the reservoir for Opae. The total length of the entire pipeline connector is 3 340,60 m.</P><P>On the chainage km 3+311,05, the route of the pipeline crosses through dry ravine, which provides a protective threshold for the insurance of the pipeline.</P><P>5 Supply main from manhole for making connections Vistica to reservoir Nikustak</P><P>Supply main from manhole for making connections Vistica to the reservoir of the settlement Nikustak, is an extension of pipeline connector 2. The connection of this pipeline to the WSS Lipkovo is envisaged in the manhole for making connections Vistica which is different from the original idea to connect in a separate manhole located at the end of pipeline connector 2. Due to this dislocation, the manhole for making connection Vistica is also changed and therefore is included in this project, and not in the project for extension of the pipeline connector 2 with ordinal number 1 Supply main pipeline connector 2 from km 3+854.90 to km 7+054.66. The route of the pipeline starts from the manhole for making connections Vistica towards the current reservoir for the settlement Nikustak. The total length of the entire pipeline is 3 689,00 m.</P></SHORT_CONTRACT_DESCRIPTION><CPV><CPV_MAIN><CPV_CODE
