                  <P>The University of Edinburgh wishes to appoint a Main Contractor to construct a new Health &amp; Wellbeing Centre at 7 Bristo Square. Existing teaching space accommodation is to be reconfigured and repurposed to create the new Centre. 7 Bristo Square is a mid-century modernist building whose character contributes to the locale.</P>
                  <P>The works entail both a refurbishment, new services and a new extension to the existing building in a constrained urban site which is located within a live University environment. There is a GP practice located on the upper floors of the building which is to remain operational throughout the works. Access to the GP practice is to be maintained at all times.</P>
                  <P>The new Health &amp; Wellbeing Centre will be formed over Level 0, Level 1 and Level 2, comprising a new single storey extension to the front of the building providing shared access to the new wellbeing centre and the existing health centre that currently occupies Levels 3 – 5. Internally at Level 0 the new facility will provide a new larger pharmacy; refurbished WC facilities; plant rooms; new consultation rooms; and access to a new lift providing vertical transportation between Level 0 – Level 2. Level 1 accommodation will provide a new reception; staff administration and welfare facilities; consultation rooms; and a new Wellbeing Lounge and Sanctuary area. Level 2 will provide further consultation rooms.</P>

               <CRITERIA_CANDIDATE>
                  <P>Evaluation.</P>
                  <P>We will apply a two stage process:</P>
                  <P>Stage 1 - Pre-qualification via the submission of the completed ESPD (Scotland).</P>
                  <P>— Bidders must pass the minimum standards (pass /fail) sections of the ESPD (Scotland). These can be found within the qualification envelope of PCS-T. Statements detailing the specific requirements can be found within Section III 1.1 &amp; 1.2 and Section VI (VI.3) of the contract notice,</P>
                  <P>— Bidders must complete the technical envelope. Specific statements detailing the requirement can be found within Section III 1.3 of the contract notice related to section 4C of the ESPD. The responses to these statements will be scored as per the scoring methodology detailed within Section 3 below. All bidders must reach a minimum pass mark of 50 per cent in order to be considered for shortlisting. We will take the six highest scoring bidders who reach the minimum pass mark through to the ITT stage and they will be invited to submit a tender.</P>
                  <P>Stage 2 - Invitation to Tender (ITT).</P>
                  <P>The University will evaluate all shortlisted bidders/tenderers ITT submissions via undertaking a Quality /Technical and Commercial evaluation. The Quality/Technical assessment will be undertaken through a marking process of responses to questions in the ITT document.</P>
                  <P>Technical (Quality) Scores shall be allocated based on the total percentage achieved by the response out of the maximum possible percentage. This takes into account the score out of 4 and the weighting allocated to individual questions. For example if a question is weighted 10 percent and your submission scores 3 points out of 4 for that question then you will receive 7.5 percent out of a possible 10 percent. eg in the event you score 4 out of 4 for all our quality questions and score 100 then you will be awarded the maximum score of 100 percent. In the event you score 2 out of 4 for all questions then your score will be 50 percent out of the quality percentage of 10 percent therefore your score would be 5 percent. Cost – the bidder who submits the lowest cost will be awarded the maximum score 90 percent and the others awarded a score pro rata, in relation to the lowest bid.</P>
                  <P>Summary.</P>
                  <P>The quality and commercial score will be combined to give each bidder /tenderer an overall total score.</P>
                  <P>Selection scoring methodology.</P>
