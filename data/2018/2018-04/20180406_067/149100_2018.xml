                  <P>On 2.10.2015 the SSI steel works in Redcar was placed into compulsory liquidation and an official receiver (OR) was appointed as liquidator. On 12 October, following no buyer for the steel works being found, the decision was taken by the official receiver to set about the hard closure of the site. Since that time the official receiver undertook a protracted liquidation of SSI and, in the absence of a new owner, he has been overseeing the safe and secure closure of the former SSI site whilst maintaining the delivery of services to other site residents. The site boundary is approximately 13.5 miles (including River Tees border) in circumference and Consists of a mixture of wooden bars, palisade, chain Link fencing – all in various states of repair and degradation. There are lengths of perimeter where no fence line or demarcation exists. This Lot will include the removal of oils and greases such as oil, oily water, greases, Benzole absorbing oil/creosote (Tonne) and heavy fuel oils. The value for this lot is indicative and is based on current inventory.
