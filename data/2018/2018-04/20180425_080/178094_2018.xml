Depending on the Financial Intermediary’s level of involvement with more vulnerable groups, this TA operation can offer FIs a range of support from investigating the possibility of serving this segment by conducting scoping studies / market research, making contact with refugees and drafting subsequent strategic plans through to conducting pilot tests and fine tuning existing products and procedures.</P><P>This component may also include the preparation and publication of case studies to help share experiences and lessons learned of Financial Intermediaries already serving these vulnerable populations with the sector at large.</P><P>Component 2: vocational training, economic empowerment and technical support for more vulnerable persons such as youth, unemployed as well as migrants and refugees.</P><P>This component aims at structuring and providing market-led vocational training with the aim of getting more vulnerable persons into formal employment and business ownership and, particularly in the case of migrants and refugees, to increase social and economic interaction with the host community. Training activities should include market orientation, cultural awareness and general life / social skills training, and may further cover topics such as languages, computer literacy, health, household budgeting, financial literacy, business management skills, technical training in marketable vocations, development of skills linked to artisan / handicraft activities etc. Activities could further include the development and roll out of market based certified technical training curricula.</P><P>Activities under this component are likely to complement training funded by humanitarian funders and donors already active in the Region. Therefore, interaction and coordination with local and international institutions / donors, universities, networks, NGOs, associations, etc. is expected.</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="003"><NO_MARK>8.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Number and titles of lots</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>Not applicable.</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="004"><NO_MARK>9.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Maximum budget</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>2 000 000 EUR</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="005"><NO_MARK>10.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Scope for additional services</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>The Contracting Authority may, at its own discretion and subject to the availability of funding, extend the scope and duration of the project to cover complementary and/or additional services.</P><P>In case of complementary services, the extension shall be up to a maximum not exeeding 50% of the initial contract value.

Depending on the Financial Intermediary’s level of involvement with more vulnerable groups, this TA operation can offer FIs a range of support from investigating the possibility of serving this segment by conducting scoping studies / market research, making contact with refugees and drafting subsequent strategic plans through to conducting pilot tests and fine tuning existing products and procedures.</P><P>This component may also include the preparation and publication of case studies to help share experiences and lessons learned of Financial Intermediaries already serving these vulnerable populations with the sector at large.</P><P>Component 2: vocational training, economic empowerment and technical support for more vulnerable persons such as youth, unemployed as well as migrants and refugees.</P><P>This component aims at structuring and providing market-led vocational training with the aim of getting more vulnerable persons into formal employment and business ownership and, particularly in the case of migrants and refugees, to increase social and economic interaction with the host community. Training activities should include market orientation, cultural awareness and general life / social skills training, and may further cover topics such as languages, computer literacy, health, household budgeting, financial literacy, business management skills, technical training in marketable vocations, development of skills linked to artisan / handicraft activities etc. Activities could further include the development and roll out of market based certified technical training curricula.</P><P>Activities under this component are likely to complement training funded by humanitarian funders and donors already active in the Region. Therefore, interaction and coordination with local and international institutions / donors, universities, networks, NGOs, associations, etc. is expected.</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="003"><NO_MARK>8.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Number and titles of lots</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>Not applicable.</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="004"><NO_MARK>9.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Maximum budget</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>2 000 000 EUR</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="005"><NO_MARK>10.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Scope for additional services</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>The Contracting Authority may, at its own discretion and subject to the availability of funding, extend the scope and duration of the project to cover complementary and/or additional services.</P><P>In case of complementary services, the extension shall be up to a maximum not exeeding 50% of the initial contract value.

Depending on the Financial Intermediary’s level of involvement with more vulnerable groups, this TA operation can offer FIs a range of support from investigating the possibility of serving this segment by conducting scoping studies / market research, making contact with refugees and drafting subsequent strategic plans through to conducting pilot tests and fine tuning existing products and procedures.</P><P>This component may also include the preparation and publication of case studies to help share experiences and lessons learned of Financial Intermediaries already serving these vulnerable populations with the sector at large.</P><P>Component 2: vocational training, economic empowerment and technical support for more vulnerable persons such as youth, unemployed as well as migrants and refugees.</P><P>This component aims at structuring and providing market-led vocational training with the aim of getting more vulnerable persons into formal employment and business ownership and, particularly in the case of migrants and refugees, to increase social and economic interaction with the host community. Training activities should include market orientation, cultural awareness and general life / social skills training, and may further cover topics such as languages, computer literacy, health, household budgeting, financial literacy, business management skills, technical training in marketable vocations, development of skills linked to artisan / handicraft activities etc. Activities could further include the development and roll out of market based certified technical training curricula.</P><P>Activities under this component are likely to complement training funded by humanitarian funders and donors already active in the Region. Therefore, interaction and coordination with local and international institutions / donors, universities, networks, NGOs, associations, etc. is expected.</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="003"><NO_MARK>8.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Number and titles of lots</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>Not applicable.</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="004"><NO_MARK>9.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Maximum budget</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>2 000 000 EUR</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="005"><NO_MARK>10.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Scope for additional services</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>The Contracting Authority may, at its own discretion and subject to the availability of funding, extend the scope and duration of the project to cover complementary and/or additional services.</P><P>In case of complementary services, the extension shall be up to a maximum not exeeding 50% of the initial contract value.

Depending on the Financial Intermediary’s level of involvement with more vulnerable groups, this TA operation can offer FIs a range of support from investigating the possibility of serving this segment by conducting scoping studies / market research, making contact with refugees and drafting subsequent strategic plans through to conducting pilot tests and fine tuning existing products and procedures.</P><P>This component may also include the preparation and publication of case studies to help share experiences and lessons learned of Financial Intermediaries already serving these vulnerable populations with the sector at large.</P><P>Component 2: vocational training, economic empowerment and technical support for more vulnerable persons such as youth, unemployed as well as migrants and refugees.</P><P>This component aims at structuring and providing market-led vocational training with the aim of getting more vulnerable persons into formal employment and business ownership and, particularly in the case of migrants and refugees, to increase social and economic interaction with the host community. Training activities should include market orientation, cultural awareness and general life / social skills training, and may further cover topics such as languages, computer literacy, health, household budgeting, financial literacy, business management skills, technical training in marketable vocations, development of skills linked to artisan / handicraft activities etc. Activities could further include the development and roll out of market based certified technical training curricula.</P><P>Activities under this component are likely to complement training funded by humanitarian funders and donors already active in the Region. Therefore, interaction and coordination with local and international institutions / donors, universities, networks, NGOs, associations, etc. is expected.</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="003"><NO_MARK>8.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Number and titles of lots</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>Not applicable.</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="004"><NO_MARK>9.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Maximum budget</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>2 000 000 EUR</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="005"><NO_MARK>10.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Scope for additional services</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>The Contracting Authority may, at its own discretion and subject to the availability of funding, extend the scope and duration of the project to cover complementary and/or additional services.</P><P>In case of complementary services, the extension shall be up to a maximum not exeeding 50% of the initial contract value.

Depending on the Financial Intermediary’s level of involvement with more vulnerable groups, this TA operation can offer FIs a range of support from investigating the possibility of serving this segment by conducting scoping studies / market research, making contact with refugees and drafting subsequent strategic plans through to conducting pilot tests and fine tuning existing products and procedures.</P><P>This component may also include the preparation and publication of case studies to help share experiences and lessons learned of Financial Intermediaries already serving these vulnerable populations with the sector at large.</P><P>Component 2: vocational training, economic empowerment and technical support for more vulnerable persons such as youth, unemployed as well as migrants and refugees.</P><P>This component aims at structuring and providing market-led vocational training with the aim of getting more vulnerable persons into formal employment and business ownership and, particularly in the case of migrants and refugees, to increase social and economic interaction with the host community. Training activities should include market orientation, cultural awareness and general life / social skills training, and may further cover topics such as languages, computer literacy, health, household budgeting, financial literacy, business management skills, technical training in marketable vocations, development of skills linked to artisan / handicraft activities etc. Activities could further include the development and roll out of market based certified technical training curricula.</P><P>Activities under this component are likely to complement training funded by humanitarian funders and donors already active in the Region. Therefore, interaction and coordination with local and international institutions / donors, universities, networks, NGOs, associations, etc. is expected.</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="003"><NO_MARK>8.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Number and titles of lots</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>Not applicable.</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="004"><NO_MARK>9.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Maximum budget</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>2 000 000 EUR</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="005"><NO_MARK>10.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Scope for additional services</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>The Contracting Authority may, at its own discretion and subject to the availability of funding, extend the scope and duration of the project to cover complementary and/or additional services.</P><P>In case of complementary services, the extension shall be up to a maximum not exeeding 50% of the initial contract value.

Depending on the Financial Intermediary’s level of involvement with more vulnerable groups, this TA operation can offer FIs a range of support from investigating the possibility of serving this segment by conducting scoping studies / market research, making contact with refugees and drafting subsequent strategic plans through to conducting pilot tests and fine tuning existing products and procedures.</P><P>This component may also include the preparation and publication of case studies to help share experiences and lessons learned of Financial Intermediaries already serving these vulnerable populations with the sector at large.</P><P>Component 2: vocational training, economic empowerment and technical support for more vulnerable persons such as youth, unemployed as well as migrants and refugees.</P><P>This component aims at structuring and providing market-led vocational training with the aim of getting more vulnerable persons into formal employment and business ownership and, particularly in the case of migrants and refugees, to increase social and economic interaction with the host community. Training activities should include market orientation, cultural awareness and general life / social skills training, and may further cover topics such as languages, computer literacy, health, household budgeting, financial literacy, business management skills, technical training in marketable vocations, development of skills linked to artisan / handicraft activities etc. Activities could further include the development and roll out of market based certified technical training curricula.</P><P>Activities under this component are likely to complement training funded by humanitarian funders and donors already active in the Region. Therefore, interaction and coordination with local and international institutions / donors, universities, networks, NGOs, associations, etc. is expected.</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="003"><NO_MARK>8.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Number and titles of lots</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>Not applicable.</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="004"><NO_MARK>9.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Maximum budget</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>2 000 000 EUR</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="005"><NO_MARK>10.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Scope for additional services</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>The Contracting Authority may, at its own discretion and subject to the availability of funding, extend the scope and duration of the project to cover complementary and/or additional services.</P><P>In case of complementary services, the extension shall be up to a maximum not exeeding 50% of the initial contract value.

Depending on the Financial Intermediary’s level of involvement with more vulnerable groups, this TA operation can offer FIs a range of support from investigating the possibility of serving this segment by conducting scoping studies / market research, making contact with refugees and drafting subsequent strategic plans through to conducting pilot tests and fine tuning existing products and procedures.</P><P>This component may also include the preparation and publication of case studies to help share experiences and lessons learned of Financial Intermediaries already serving these vulnerable populations with the sector at large.</P><P>Component 2: vocational training, economic empowerment and technical support for more vulnerable persons such as youth, unemployed as well as migrants and refugees.</P><P>This component aims at structuring and providing market-led vocational training with the aim of getting more vulnerable persons into formal employment and business ownership and, particularly in the case of migrants and refugees, to increase social and economic interaction with the host community. Training activities should include market orientation, cultural awareness and general life / social skills training, and may further cover topics such as languages, computer literacy, health, household budgeting, financial literacy, business management skills, technical training in marketable vocations, development of skills linked to artisan / handicraft activities etc. Activities could further include the development and roll out of market based certified technical training curricula.</P><P>Activities under this component are likely to complement training funded by humanitarian funders and donors already active in the Region. Therefore, interaction and coordination with local and international institutions / donors, universities, networks, NGOs, associations, etc. is expected.</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="003"><NO_MARK>8.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Number and titles of lots</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>Not applicable.</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="004"><NO_MARK>9.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Maximum budget</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>2 000 000 EUR</P></TXT_MARK></MLI_OCCUR><MLI_OCCUR NO_SEQ="005"><NO_MARK>10.</NO_MARK><TI_MARK>Scope for additional services</TI_MARK><TXT_MARK><P>The Contracting Authority may, at its own discretion and subject to the availability of funding, extend the scope and duration of the project to cover complementary and/or additional services.</P><P>In case of complementary services, the extension shall be up to a maximum not exeeding 50% of the initial contract value.
