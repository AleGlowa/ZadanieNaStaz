The MOD will rely upon a successful contract to enable their own change strategies for personnel to be delivered; and</P><P>i. Engagement with multiple third parties on behalf of DBS.</P><P>The delivery of these services/outputs will initially be supported by a range of existing applications and technologies that are already in place; these include Oracle Human resource management system (HRMS) configured to deliver JPA, plus various Compensation and pensions systems (with varying degrees of integration to JPA). In addition there are several other complementary applications and a Management information platform. Multiple interfaces exist between internally hosted applications and also with external organisations and their applications.</P><P>The IS service requirement is to manage and maintain all IT services in accordance with mature IT service management (ITSM) practices. The ITSM provisions will include, but not limited to, ensuring service provision is compliant with overall requirements, applying any necessary upgrades/patches, ensuring licensing and security compliance, ensuring tactical and transformational changes are non-impactive to operational services, ensuring the Authority have access to suitable levels of service information and ensuring a suitable service strategy is developed and maintained.</P><P>The FSDC must:</P><P>a.

Improve and expand the Management information capability that is delivered to the consumers of the service, i.e. the single services and other Authority professional users; and</P><P>e. Transition towards a more modularised and disaggregated service.</P><P>The Authority recognises the need for enterprise wide changes to facilitate this, which will include, but not be limited to:</P><P>a. Organisation, Process and governance transformation: Matured ITSM approaches, improved business change processes, improved innovation, and enhanced collaboration and transparency between supplier and authority;</P><P>b. Information and data management transformation: Data architecture changes, making better use of data and ensuring ongoing compliance with current and new security and privacy standards; and</P><P>c. Application and technology transformation: Enhancing user access options, improving functionality to better address user needs, increased standardisation and decoupling of technology components leading to more portable services and allowing consumption of other hosted/cloud options (including shared MOD services), and overall improved use of assets.</P><P>Optional services.</P><P>Options will be sought for the following services that are currently delivered in house:</P><P>a. Administration of the war pensions scheme and Armed forces compensation scheme (including payment and financial accounting with interfaces to other MOD and OGD financial systems);</P><P>b.
