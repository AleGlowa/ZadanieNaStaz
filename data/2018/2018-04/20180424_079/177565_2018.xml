                  <P>Delivery of Dual Outlet AC Charger 7kW and 22kW, Post and wall/pole mounted types charging equipment will be to locations in Ireland (Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland). The appointed framework agreement providers will be required to upgrade their equipment and services to ESB as improved or new equipment and associated peripherals/services become available.</P>
                  <P>It is envisaged that ESB shall enter into framework agreements with the three highest scoring successful tenderers for each lot following the completion of the procurement process. Applicants should note that the Contract may ultimately be entered into by any subsidiary or affiliate thereof.</P>
                  <P>Purchase under these frameworks/lots will be awarded by cascade to a maximum estimated value of 25 000 EUR per individual purchase. The highest scoring successful tenderer in each lot being given first preference to supply products at the rates given in their tender submission, where the first placed tenderer is unable to fulfill the requirement of the order for whatever reason, the second placed tenderer will be requested to supply products at the rates given in their tender submission. Where the second placed tenderer is unable to fulfill the requirement of the order for whatever reason, the third placed tenderer will be requested to supply products at the rates given in their tender submission.</P>
                  <P>For purchases of estimated value above 25 000 EUR a mini-tender of the framework/lot members will be undertaken by ESB.</P>
                  <P>If for any reason it is not possible to award membership on a framework to any of the three highest scoring successful tenderers, or if having awarded membership on a framework ESB considers that a successful tenderer has not met its obligations, ESB reserves the right to award membership on a framework to the next highest scoring tenderer.</P>
                  <P>Successful Tenderers will be notified of their rank, i.e. 1st or 2<FT TYPE="SUP">nd</FT> or 3<FT TYPE="SUP">rd</FT> in each lot/framework agreement at contract award stage. ESB reserves the right to change rankings at ESB discretion where a successful tenderer is considered by ESB to have not met ESB’s requirements.</P>
                  <P>Applicants may apply for one or all lots, and an applicant may be successful in qualifying for one, multiple or all lots depending on the evaluation of their submission for each lot.</P>

               <P>1) Interested parties must register their interest on the eTenders web site (www.etenders.gov.ie) in order to be included on the mailing list for clarifications. All information relating to attachments, including clarifications and changes, will be published on the Irish Government Procurement Opportunities Portal (www.etenders.gov.ie) only. Registration is free of charge. The contracting entity will not accept responsibility for information relayed (or not relayed) via third parties.</P>
               <P>2) This is the sole call for competition for these supplies.</P>
               <P>3) The contracting entity will not be responsible for any costs, charges or expenses incurred by candidates or tenderers.</P>
               <P>4) Contract award will be subject to the approval of the competent authorities.</P>
               <P>5) It will be a condition of award that candidates are tax compliant.</P>
               <P>6) If for any reason it is not possible to admit to the framework agreement one or more of the tenderers invited following the conclusion of this competitive process, or having awarded a contract under the framework agreement, the contracting entity reserves the right to invite the next highest scoring tenderer to join the framework agreement and/or deliver the contract as appropriate to the circumstances pertaining to the framework.</P>
               <P>7) At its absolute discretion, the contracting entity may elect to terminate this procurement process, the framework agreement or any contract awarded under the framework agreement at any time.</P>
               <P>8) Please note in relation to all documents, that where reference is made to a particular standard, make, source, process, trademark, type or patent, that this is not to be regarded as a de facto requirement. In all such cases it should be understood that such indications are to be treated strictly and solely for reference purposes only, to which the words "or equivalent" will always be appended.</P>
               <P>9) Without prejudice to the principle of equal treatment, the contracting entity is not obliged to engage in a clarification process in respect of questionnaires with missing or incomplete information. Therefore, candidates are advised to ensure that they return fully completed questionnaires in order to avoid the risk of elimination from the competition.</P>
               <P>10) At Section II.2.9 we have indicated that 5 applicants will be invited to tender, please note that the contracting entity reserves the right to invite at least 5 applicants subject to that number qualifying.</P>
