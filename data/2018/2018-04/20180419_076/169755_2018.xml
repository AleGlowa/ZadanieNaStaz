               <SHORT_DESCR>
                  <P>Hertfordshire County Council is responsible for commissioning a range of services to support children, young people and their families achieve their full potential. Many of these services, while working together in many ways, could still be improved through greater integration and alignment of pathways and premises. The previous contracts of Public health nursing services (health visiting and school nursing) and Children’s services children’s centres delivered a service to families that, while often working together, operated separately, often even having separate offices and premises. By commissioning these services collaboratively, families will be able to access integrated services through one branded offer: Hertfordshire’s family centre services. Families have told us that they want to access a wider range of services from every person they see, making it quicker and easier for them while more easily accessing specialist professionals they need to (such as health visitors, school nurses, family support etc.) It is the intention that the Family centre services are locally driven, needs led services from pre-birth through to 19, universally available but responsive across the continuum, intervening as soon as problems arise to support families to achieve the best outcome, prevent escalation into more costly services and to support the Council’s priorities in delivering services for the future. The service will be aligned at the point of delivery and incorporate a whole system methodology, enabling strong links, pathways and partnerships with schools, early years settings, early help services (Families first), social care and other health services (such as Speech and Language, CAMHS, community paediatricians) so that services are delivered in an integrated manner with professionals working as a team to support babies, children, young people and their families to thrive. It is the Council’s absolute expectation that the provider(s) awarded the above contracts work in a cohesive and aligned partnership to collectively deliver a unified Family centre service to the families they collectively serve. The estimated total value of the whole procurement is stated in II.1.7 of this notice and is for the initial term inclusive of the approximate value for extensions. This value also includes the estimated value for the potential additional services element of this procurement detailed in VI.3 (Additional Information). The initial term of this contract is 6 years with a possible extension of up to a further 2 years at the Councils discretion.</P>

                  <P>Hertfordshire County Council is responsible for commissioning a range of services to support children, young people and their families achieve their full potential. Many of these services, while working together in many ways, could still be improved through greater integration and alignment of pathways and premises. The previous contracts of Public health nursing services (health visiting and school nursing) and Children’s services children’s centres delivered a service to families that, while often working together, operated separately, often even having separate offices and premises. By commissioning these services collaboratively, families will be able to access integrated services through one branded offer: Hertfordshire’s Family centre services. Families have told us that they want to access a wider range of services from every person they see, making it quicker and easier for them while more easily accessing specialist professionals they need to (such as health visitors, school nurses, family support etc.) It is the intention that the Family centre services are locally driven, needs led services from pre-birth through to 19, universally available but responsive across the continuum, intervening as soon as problems arise to support families to achieve the best outcome, prevent escalation into more costly services and to support the Council’s priorities in delivering services for the future. The service will be aligned at the point of delivery and incorporate a whole system methodology, enabling strong links, pathways and partnerships with schools, early years settings, early help services (Families first), social care and other health services (such as Speech and Language, CAMHS, community paediatricians) so that services are delivered in an integrated manner with professionals working as a team to support babies, children, young people and their families to thrive. It is the Council’s absolute expectation that the provider(s) awarded the above contracts work in a cohesive and aligned partnership to collectively deliver a unified Family Centre Service to the families they collectively serve. The estimated total value of the whole procurement is stated in II.1.7 of this notice and is for the initial term inclusive of the approximate value for extensions. This value also includes the estimated value for the potential additional services element of this procurement detailed in VI.3 (Additional Information). The initial term of this contract is 6 years with a possible extension of up to a further 2 years at the Councils discretion.</P>
