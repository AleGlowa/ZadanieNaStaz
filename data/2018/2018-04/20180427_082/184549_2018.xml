            <INFO_ADD>
               <P>The Agreement is entered into by DC DKN. However, the Agreement can also be used by the following authorities: Greenland Police Authorities (placed under the Danish Ministry of Justice) and Greenland Health Authorities. DC DKN is responsible for carrying out the procurement procedure and act in its own name and on behalf of the other participating Contracting Authorities. The participating Contracting Authorities shall be jointly responsible for fulfilling the obligations stipulated in Danish Act of Public Procurement (nº 1564 of 15.12.2015).</P>
               <P>DC DKN demands that the tenderer and each of the legal entities whose capacities the tenderer relies on undertake joint and several liability for the performance of the contract.</P>
               <P>The use of the ESPD is a precondition for participation in the procurement procedure, cf. § 148 of the Public Procurement Act. DALO shall require that the tenderer apply the ESPD as preliminary evidence that the tenderer is not subject to the grounds of exclusion stipulated in §§ 135 and 136 of the said Act and that the tenderer fulfils the minimum requirements for suitability fixed in accordance with § 140, cf. Section III.1.2).</P>
               <P>The tenderers and, if relevant, the participants in the group of entities and/or supporting entities, must use the electronic version of the ESPD. DC DKN has prepared an ESPD (an XML-file) available atwww.digitaleudbud.dk</P>
               <P>Defence Command Denmark strongly encourages the tenderer to use this XML-file when completing the ESPD. The tenderer must upload the XML-file to this website https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/espd/welcome where the ESPD can be completed and later exported. No other versions than the EPSD must be used.</P>
               <P>The tenderer may submit an ESPD for each lot.</P>
               <P>Prior to decision on award of the contract, DC DKN shall require that the tenderer to whom DC DKN intends to award the contract presents documentation for the information stated in the ESPD, cf. §§ 151-155 of the said Act. If a tenderer relies on the capacity of other entities, cf. Section III.1.2, the tenderer shall upon request provide statements of support or other documentation proving that the tenderer has access to the necessary economic and financial standing, and that the entity referred to has a legal obligation to the tenderer. If such documentation is not provided, DC DKN cannot consider the economic and financial standing of the other entity or entities. DC DKN has prepared a template to be used to confirm the legal obligation which is available at www.digitaleudbud.dk</P>
               <P>DC DKN strongly encourages the tenderers to use this form. However, it is emphasized that it is the sole responsibility of the tenderer that the information provided fulfils the requirements.</P>
               <P>If the same legal entity is a part of or in any other way participates in several offers, e.g. submits his own offer and at the same time participates in a consortium which also submits an offer, the tenderers shall ensure that the same legal entity’s participation does not provide for opportunity for mutual coordination of their offers. DCDKN reserves the right to request the tenderers to establish and reassure Defence Command Denmark that the same legal entity’s participation does not threaten the transparency and distort competition between the tenderers.</P>
               <P>Regarding Section II.1.6): since the procurement is divided into lots the tenderer is asked to state in the ESPD Part II, Section A which lot or lots the offer concerns. Please note, that a tenderer can only submit one offer for each lot.</P>
               <P>DC DKN reserves the right — but is not obliged — to use the remedies provided for in Section 159(5) of the Danish Act on Public Procurement (act nº 1564 of 15.12.2015) if applications or offers do not fulfil the formalities of the tender documents.</P>
