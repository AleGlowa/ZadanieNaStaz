               <P>Be advised that DALO at any time during the procurement procedure can request that the tenderer presents the above mentioned documentation if this is deemed necessary to secure that the procurement procedure is conducted correctly. In this situation, DALO will set an appropriate time limit for the submission of the documentation.</P>
               <P>Please note that a tenderer may rely on the economic and financial standing of other entities (e.g. a parent or sister company or a sub supplier), irrespective of the legal nature of the relations between the tenderer and the entity or entities on which the tenderer relies. In this case, the tenderer shall ensure that an ESPD from the entity or entities on which the tenderer relies is submitted along with the tenderers own ESPD. The entity or entities’ ESPD must equally provide the information listed above.</P>

               <P>The use of the ESPD is a precondition for participation in the procurement procedure, cf. § 148 of the public procurement act. DALO shall require that the tenderer apply the ESPD as preliminary evidence that the tenderer is not subject to the grounds of exclusion stipulated in §§ 135 and 136 of the said act, that the tenderer fulfills the minimum requirements for suitability fixed in accordance with § 140, cf. section III.1.2) and III.1.3).</P>
               <P>The tenderers and, if relevant, the participants in the group of entities and /or supporting entities, must use the electronic version of the ESPD. DALO has prepared an ESPD (an XML-file) available at EU supply. DALO strongly encourages the tenderer to use this XML-file when completing the ESPD. The tenderer must upload the XML-file to this website https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/espd/welcome where the ESPD can be completed and later exported. No other versions than the EPSD must be used.</P>
               <P>Prior to decision on award of the contract, DALO shall require that the tenderer to whom DALO intends to award the contract presents documentation for the information stated in the ESPD, cf. §§ 151-155 of the said Act. If a tenderer relies on the capacity of other entities, cf. section III.1.2 and III.1.3, the tenderer shall upon request provide statements of support or other documentation proving that the tenderer has access to the necessary economic and financial standing and /or technical and professional capacity, and that the entity referred to has a legal obligation to the tenderer. If such documentation is not provided, DALO cannot consider the economic and financial standing and /or the technical and professional capacity of the other entity or entities. DALO has prepared a template to be used to confirm the legal obligation which is available at EU supply. DALO strongly encourages the tenderers to use this form. However, it is emphasized that it is the sole responsibility of the tenderer that the information provided fulfills the requirements.</P>
               <P>DALO shall exclude a tenderer from participation in the procurement procedure, if the tenderer is subject to one of the compulsory grounds for exclusion in §§ 135 and 136 of the said act unless the tenderer has provided sufficient documentation that the tenderer is reliable in accordance to § 138 of the said act. Please note that certain voluntary exclusion grounds in Directive 2014/24/EU on public procurement have been made compulsory in § 136 of the said Act.</P>
               <P>If the same legal entity is a part of or in any other way participates in several offers, e.g. submits his own offer and at the same time participates in a consortium which also submits an offer, the tenderers shall ensure that the same legal entity’s participation does not provide for opportunity for mutual coordination of their offers. DALO re-serves the right to request the tenderers to establish and reassure DALO that the same legal entity’s participation does not threaten the transparency and distort competition between the tenderers.</P>
               <P>DALO reserves the right – but is not obliged – to use the remedies provided for in Section 159(5) of the the Danish Act on Public Procurement (act nº 1564 of 15.12.2015 – available at www.retsinformation.dk ) if applications or offers do not fulfill the formalities of the tender documents.</P>
