               <P>The tenderer must use the European Single Procurement Document (electronic version, hereafter ESPD) and provide the following information in the ESPD:</P>
               <P>A list of the most important similar deliveries (references), cf. Section II.1.4) and II.2.4), in regard to the lot or lots in respect of which the tenderer has submitted an offer, carried out within the past 3 (three) years, prior to the deadline for the submission of the offer, cf. Part IV, section C.</P>
               <P>The list should preferably include a short description of each delivery. The description should include a clear indication of which specific parts of the deliveries that are similar to the supplies as described in Section II.1.4) and II.2.4) in regard to the lot or lots in respect of which the tenderer has submitted an offer. The description should also include a description of the tenderers participation/role in the performance of the deliveries. The description should contain information on the date of the deliveries, the size and value of the deliveries, the recipients of the deliveries (specific names/countries are preferred, but not necessary; if no country specific information is included, the tenderer is asked to provide as much generic information as possible about the delivery). When specifying the date for the deliveries, the tenderer should state the date of commencement and completion. If this is not possible, e.g. because the delivery in question is performed on an ongoing basis according to a framework agreement, the description of the deliveries should nonetheless contain information on how the date is set.</P>
               <P>Only the deliveries (references) performed at the time of the deadline for the submission of the offer will be considered when assessing if the minimum requirement for suitability stated below is fulfilled. If the delivery in question is ongoing, it is only the part of the supplies performed and completed at the time of the deadline for the request to submission of the offer which will be included in the assessment of the delivery.</P>
               <P>The list must contain a maximum of 3 previous deliveries whether the tenderer is one entity, composed of a group of entities (e.g. consortium), including temporary joint ventures or relies on the technical and professional capacity of other entities. If the list contains more than 3, DALO will only consider the first 3 deliveries on the list. Deliveries beyond this number will be disregarded.</P>
               <P>A tenderer may rely on the technical and professional capacity of other entities (e.g. a parent or sister company or a sub supplier), irrespective of the legal nature of the relations between the tenderer and the entity or entities on which the tenderer relies. In this case, the tenderer shall ensure that an ESPD from the entity or entities on which the tenderer relies is submitted along with the tenderers own ESPD. The entity or entities’ ESPD must equally provide the information listed above.</P>
               <P>The tenderer will not be required to present further documentation for the technical and professional capacity (i.e. the information stated in the ESPD is considered sufficient). However, DALO reserves the right to contact the tenderer and/or the recipients of the deliveries in order to verify the information stated in Part IV, section C in the ESPD, including details on the specified dates of the performance of the deliveries.</P>

            <TECHNICAL_PROFESSIONAL_MIN_LEVEL>
               <P>The tenderer must demonstrate experience with as a minimum 1 similar delivery within the past 3 years, prior to the deadline for the submission of the offer.</P>
               <P>A similar delivery means that the tender has experience with delivering deliverables in regard to the lot or lots to a ministry or any other national or federal authority including their regional or local subdivision.</P>

            <INFO_ADD>
               <P>DALO demands that the tenderer and each of the legal entities whose capacities the tenderer relies on undertake joint and several liability for the performance of the contract.</P>
               <P>The use of the ESPD is a precondition for participation in the procurement procedure, cf. § 148 of the Public Procurement Act. DALO shall require that the tenderer apply the ESPD as preliminary evidence that the tenderer is not subject to the grounds of exclusion stipulated in §§ 135 and 136 of the said Act, that the tenderer fulfils the minimum requirements for suitability fixed in accordance with § 140, cf. Section III.1.2) and III.1.3), and how the candidate fulfils the objective and non-discriminatory criteria of selection, cf. § 145(2), cf. section II.2.9).</P>
               <P>The tenderers and, if relevant, the participants in the group of entities and/or supporting entities, must use the electronic version of the ESPD. DALO has prepared an ESPD (an XML-file) available at ETHICS. DALO strongly encourages the tenderer to use this XML-file when completing the ESPD. The tenderer must upload the XML-file to this website https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/espd/welcome where the ESPD can be completed and later exported. No other versions than the EPSD must be used.</P>
               <P>The tenderer may submit an ESPD for each lot.</P>
               <P>Prior to decision on award of the contract, DALO shall require that the tenderer to whom DALO intends to award the contract presents documentation for the information stated in the ESPD, cf. §§ 151-155 of the said Act. If a tenderer relies on the capacity of other entities, cf. Section III.1.2 and III.1.3, the tenderer shall upon request provide statements of support or other documentation proving that the tenderer has access to the necessary economic and financial standing and/or technical and professional capacity, and that the entity referred to has a legal obligation to the tenderer. If such documentation is not provided, DALO cannot consider the economic and financial standing and/or the technical and professional capacity of the other entity or entities. DALO has prepared a template to be used to confirm the legal obligation which is available at ETHICS. DALO strongly encourages the tenderers to use this form. However, it is emphasized that it is the sole responsibility of the tenderer that the information provided fulfils the requirements.</P>
               <P>DALO shall exclude a tenderer from participation in the procurement procedure, if the tenderer is subject to one of the compulsory grounds for exclusion in §§ 135 and 136 of the said Act unless the tenderer has provided sufficient documentation that the tenderer is reliable in accordance to § 138 of the said Act. Please note that certain voluntary exclusion grounds in Directive 2014/24/EU on public procurement have been made compulsory in § 136 of the said Act.</P>
               <P>If the same legal entity is a part of or in any other way participates in several offers, e.g. submits his own offer and at the same time participates in a consortium which also submits an offer, the tenderers shall ensure that the same legal entity’s participation does not provide for opportunity for mutual coordination of their offers. DALO reserves the right to request the tenderers to establish and reassure DALO that the same legal entity’s participation does not threaten the transparency and distort competition between the tenderers.</P>
               <P>Regarding Contract Notice Section II.1.6): Since the procurement is divided into lots the tenderer is asked to state in the ESPD Part II, section A which lot or lots the offer concerns. Please note, that a tenderer can only submit one offer for each lot.</P>
               <P>DALO reserves the right – but is not obliged – to use the remedies provided for in Section 159(5) of the the Danish Act on Public Procurement (act no. 1564 of 15.12.2015 – available at www.retsinformation.dk) if applications or offers do not fulfil the formalities of the tender documents.</P>
