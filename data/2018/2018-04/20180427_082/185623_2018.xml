The description should also contain information on the date of the deliveries, the size and value of the deliveries, the recipients of the deliveries (specific names/countries are preferred, but not necessary; if no country specific information is included, the candidate is asked to provide as much generic information as possible about the delivery). When specifying the date for the deliveries, the candidate should state the date for the commencement and completion of the deliveries.
