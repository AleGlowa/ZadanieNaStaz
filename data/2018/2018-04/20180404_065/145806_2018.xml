However, from 1.1.2016 all MOD suppliers are required to hold Cyber Essentials certification as a minimum for new contracts involving the transfer of MOD Identifiable Information from customer to supplier or the generation of this type of information by a supplier specifically in support of the contract. From 1.10.2017, the requirement for compliance with the cyber security controls is being extended to apply throughout the Defence supply chain. A Cyber Risk assessment has been undertaken for this requirement and is set as a “Low Risk”. The Risk Assessment Reference is RAR-MQBZ7P27. All potential suppliers who are invited to tender must complete the Supplier Assurance Questionnaire (SAQ) via the Supplier Cyber Protection Service (Octavian) to demonstrate their compliance with the required cyber risk level.</P><P>Друга допълнителна информация</P><P>The Contracting Authority considers that this contract may be suitable for economic operators that are Small or Medium Enterprises (SMEs).
