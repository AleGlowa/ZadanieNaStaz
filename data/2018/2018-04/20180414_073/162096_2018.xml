            <REVIEW_PROCEDURE>
               <P>This procurement is governed by the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 and provides for economic operators who have suffered, or who risk suffering, loss, or damage, as a consequence of an alleged breach of the duty owed in accordance with Regulation 91 to start proceedings in the High Court. A standstill period will commence at the point information on the award of the contract is communicated to Tenderers. That notification will provide information on the award decision. The standstill period, which will be for a minimum of 10 calendar days, provides time for unsuccessful Tenderers to challenge the award decision before the contract is entered into. Any proceedings relating to any perceived non-compliance with the relevant law must be started within 30 days, beginning with the date when the economic operator first knew, or ought to have known that grounds for starting the proceedings had arisen (A court may extend the time limit to 3 months, where the court considers that there is a good reason for doing so).</P>
