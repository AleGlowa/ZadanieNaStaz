               <P>Economic operators must complete Part 3: Section 6 of the SQ.</P>
               <P>Economic operators must provide details of up to 3 contracts, in any combination from either the public or private sector; voluntary, charity or social enterprise ("VCSE") that are relevant to the principal contracting authority's requirements. VCSEs may include samples of grant-funded work. Contracts for supplies or services should have been performed during the past 3 years. Works Contracts may be from the past 5 years. The named contact provided should be able to provide written evidence to the principal contracting authority to confirm the accuracy of the information provided. Consortia bids should provide relevant examples of where the consortium has delivered similar requirements; if this is not possible (e.g. the Consortium is newly formed or a Special Purpose Vehicle (“SPV”) will be created for this contract) then three(3) separate examples should be provided between the principal member(s) of the proposed Consortium or SPV (three (3) examples are not required from each member). Where the economic operator is a SPV, or a Managing Agent not intending to be the main provider of the supplies or services, the information requested should be provided in respect of the main intended provider(s) or sub-contractor(s) who will deliver the contract. If the economic operator cannot provide at least one (1) example for Questions 6.1 see Question 6.3, in no more than five hundred (500) words, economic operators must provide an explanation for this e.g. is economic operator's organisation a new start-up or have you provided services in the past but not under a contract.</P>

               <P>Responses to Section 6 will be scored as follows:</P>
               <P>Pass - The economic operator has provided either:</P>
               <P>1. at least one example of a previous contract that meets the minimum requirements set out in Section 6, and demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the principal Contracting Authority that the economic operator possesses the relevant general technical expertise and professional experience to be entrusted with the principal contracting authority's contract.</P>
               <P>OR.</P>
               <P>2. a satisfactory reason as to why the economic operator is unable to provide any examples of previous contracts that are relevant to the principal Contracting Authority's requirements under this Procurement, and that meets the minimum requirements set out in Question 6.3.</P>
               <P>However, economic operators are asked to note that:</P>
               <P>(i) If economic operators need to use more than one example to demonstrate that they possess the relevant general technical expertise and professional experience, they may do so up to a maximum of 3 examples.</P>
               <P>(ii) The principal Contracting Authority reserves the right to confirm the accuracy of any information provided in response to Section 6 with any named customer contact(s).</P>
               <P>(iii) Any replies from any named customer contact(s) which lead the principal Contracting Authority, acting reasonably, to doubt any significant representations made in the economic operator's responses to Section 6 may result in exclusion.</P>
               <P>Fail — The economic operator:</P>
               <P>1. has failed to provide any examples of any previous contracts in response to Section 6; and</P>
               <P>Has failed to provide a satisfactory reason as to why they were unable to provide any examples;</P>
               <P>OR.</P>
               <P>2. the examples given in response to Section 6 do not demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the principal Contracting Authority that the economic operator possesses the relevant general technical expertise and professional experience to be entrusted with the principal Contracting Authority's Contract.</P>

               <P>The principal Contracting Authority (i.e. the Council of the Borough of Kirklees) is the only Contracting Authority that will enter into any Framework agreement with the successful economic operators. The other contracting authorities listed in Section I.1 of this Notice above shall be permitted to use the Framework agreement to call-off contracts in relation to the lot relevant to each individual Contracting Authority. In addition, the Framework Agreement may be used by any of the other “Local Authorities” (as defined under the Local Government Act 1972 (SI 1972/070)) within the Yorkshire and Humber Region. A map and list of the other Local Authorities permitted to use the Framework Agreement can be found in Appendix 1 of File 01 of the procurement documentation (available to download at https://www.yortender.co.uk/procontract/supplier.nsf).The principal Contracting Authority considers that this Framework Agreement may be suitable for economic operators that are small or medium enterprises (“SMEs”). However, any selection of economic operators will be based solely on the criteria set out for the procurement, and the Framework Agreement will be awarded on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender based on lowest price only. The award criteria is set out in the procurement documentation (available to download at https://www.yortender.co.uk/procontract/supplier.nsf). With regards to the estimated total value of services for the entire duration of the Framework Agreement, economic operators should note that the values stipulated in Section II.1.5 of this Notice above covers the potential spend of all the participating contracting authorities, throughout the duration of the Framework Agreement. Notwithstanding the range of values stipulated in Section II.1.5, however, for the avoidance of doubt economic operators should note that:</P>
               <P>i) The estimates given in Section II.1.5 of this Notice are strictly estimated values only.</P>
               <P>ii) Any information supplied in the procurement documents as to the likely volumes of services or the times when they are likely to be required are given purely as indication of past experiences of the contracting authorities.</P>
               <P>iii) Furthermore, please note that estimates given in Section II.1.5 of this Notice are based on third party estimates of anticipated future workloads during the Framework Period as at the date of this Notice, and the principal Contracting Authority gives no warranty as to the accuracy to said data.</P>
               <P>iv) The anticipated usage of this Framework agreement is unknown at present. Economic operators should note that it is not possible to establish an exact future workload and it is therefore not possible to guarantee that all or any of the successful economic operators with whom the principal Contracting Authority enters into the Framework Agreement will in fact be called upon to execute Services on behalf of the principal Contracting Authority or any of the other contracting authorities. Unless otherwise specifically stated elsewhere in the procurement documents, there is no minimum or maximum value/quantity of Services that may be ordered on any one occasion and the rates tendered must therefore reflect the likelihood of varying magnitude of Services and types of Services</P>
               <P>v) No Contracting Authority is bound to enter into any Task Order or other contract following discussions or other representations and no Contracting Authority shall incur any liability in respect of any failure to enter into any Service Contract or in connection with the total volume, type of Services or value of Services anticipated by any of the economic operators or which any economic operator is asked to carry out.</P>

            <REVIEW_PROCEDURE>
               <P>In accordance with Regulation 86 (Notices of decisions to award a contract or conclude a framework agreement), Regulation 87 (Standstill periods) and Chapter 6 (Applications to Court) of the Public Contract Regulations 2015 (SI 2015/102), the principal Contracting Authority has incorporated a minimum ten (10) calendar day standstill period at the point that information on the conclusion of the Framework Agreement was communicated to economic operators. This period allowed any unsuccessful economic operator(s) to seek further debriefing from the Contracting Authority before the award (or non-award) of the Framework agreement. Such additional information should have been (and can still be) requested from the address at Sections I.1 and I.3 of this Notice above. If an appeal regarding the award (or non-award) of the Framework agreement has not been successfully resolved, then the Regulations provide for aggrieved parties who have been harmed or are at risk of harm by a breach of the rules to take action in the High Court (England, Wales and Northern Ireland). Any such action must be started within 30 days beginning with the date when the aggrieved party first knew or sought to have grounds for starting the proceedings had arisen. The Court may extend the time limited for starting proceedings where the Court considers that there is a good reason for doing so, but not so as to permit proceedings to be started more than 3 months after that date. Where the Framework agreement has not been awarded, the Court may order the setting aside of the award decision or order the Contracting Authority to amend any document and may award damages. If however the Framework agreement has been awarded, the Court may only award damages or, where the contract award procedures have not been followed correctly, declare the Framework agreement to be ineffective.</P>
