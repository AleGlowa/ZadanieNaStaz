            <REVIEW_PROCEDURE>
               <P>Crescent Purchasing Consortium will incorporate a minimum 10-day standstill period at the point information on the award of contract is communicated to tenderers. Bidders who are unsuccessful shall be informed by the Contracting Authority as soon as possible after the decision is made as to the reasons why the bidder was unsuccessful. If an appeal regarding the award of the contract has not been successfully resolved, the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 provide for the aggrieved parties who have been harmed or who are at risk of harm by the breach of the rules to take action in the High Court (England, Wales and Northern Ireland). Any action must be generally brought within 3 months. If a declaration of ineffectiveness is sought, any such action must be brought within 30 days where the Contracting Authority has communicated the award of the contract and a summary of reasons to tenderers, or otherwise within 6 months of the contract being entered into. Where a contract has not been entered into, the Court may order the setting aside of the award decision or order the Contracting Authority to amend any document and may award damages. If the Contract has been entered into the Court may, depending on the circumstances, award damages, make a declaration of ineffectiveness, order the Contracting Authority to pay a fine, and/or order that the duration of the contract the shortened. The purpose of the standstill period referred to above is to allow the parties to apply to the Courts to set aside the award decision before the contract is entered into.</P>
