               <P>The contracting authority will assess each individual participant in the group in terms of the rejection provisions, cf. § 24-2 following. This, with the exception of the provision in § 24-2 (1) letter a) (fulfilment of qualification requirements), which will be applied to the group as a whole.</P>
               <P>Tenderers who are newly established companies and cannot submit all the documentation required under point 6 below, must be particularly careful to document and demonstrate that they have what it takes to fulfil the contract.</P>
               <P>It is particularly important that such tenderers can document a sufficient workforce to fulfil the contract, including professional and technical competence. For newly established tenderers, emphasis is put on the fact that it is the tenderer´s ability as such to fulfil the contract that will be assessed, not individual persons´ competence seen in isolation.</P>
               <P>If a newly established tenderer has experience from contracts, the most relevant contracts that the tenderer has experience from shall be added, in accordance with the documentation requirements in point 2. This applies even if the contracts are of such a nature that they do not fulfil the stated requirements.</P>
               <P>Missing or insufficient documentation for one or several criteria can lead to a tenderer being rejected. A missing or incorrectly completed reply form can also lead to rejection, cf. § 24-1 (2) letter b).</P>
            </SUITABILITY>

The tenderer shall substantiate why he can’t present the documentation required by the Contracting Authority.</P>

               <P>— Versions of the European Self-Declaration Form (ESPD) for each company as part of the tender, cf. point 6.</P>
               <P>Where a tenderer relies on the capacity of other companies to fulfil the economic and financial capacity requirements, the contracting authority requires that they are joint and severally liable for the execution of the contract cf. § 16-10 (4).</P>
